The district court, after determining that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, dismissed Palacios\\u2019s complaint, denied his motion for leave to amend the complaint, and rejected his motion to transfer the case to the United States Court of Federal Claims. Palacios v. Spencer, 267 F.Supp.3d 1 (D.D.C. 2017). Palacios appeals each of the district court\\u2019s rulings. Palacios served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1992 to 1995. He received an other-than-honorable discharge stemming from his pattern of misconduct. In about 2002 and 2009, he sought an upgrade of his discharge on the basis that his misconduct resulted from his mental and physical disabilities. The Naval Discharge Review Board denied both of his requests. Palacios then asked the Board for Correction of Naval Records to correct his records. The Correction Board denied his request in 2010. In response, Palacios filed an action for judicial review of the Correction Board\\u2019s decision in the Court of Federal Claims. The Claims Court dismissed his suit as untimely under the statute of limitations applicable to his wrongful-discharge claim. Palacios v. United States, 100 Fed.Cl. 656 (2011). The Federal Circuit affirmed. Palacios v. United States, No. 2012-5028, 2012 WL 2415348 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 8, 2012) (per curiam) (unpublished order). This appeal arises from Palacios\\u2019s request that the Correction Board reconsider its decision. After the Board denied this request in 2015, Palacios filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. He claimed that the Board\\u2019s denial of reconsideration was arbitrary and capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, and contrary to law under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2). His prayer for relief asked the district court to enter judgment correcting his disability rating and discharge, awarding costs and attorneys\\u2019 fees, and \\u201c[g]ranting Plaintiff appropriate back pay and benefits that would natural[ly] flow from the upgrade in discharge status.\\u201d In the alternative, he asked the district court to remand to the Correction Board for consideration on the merits. The government moved to dismiss on the ground that Palacios\\u2019s complaint fell outside the applicable statute of limitations and that it asserted a claim under the Tucker Act over which the Court of Federal Claims had exclusive jurisdiction. In his opposition to the government\\u2019s motion to dismiss, Palacios moved for leave to amend his complaint by dropping his request for money damages or, in the alternative, to transfer the case to the Court of Federal Claims. When a party in the district court moves to transfer the case to the Court of Federal Claims, see 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1631, a statutory procedure is triggered: \\u201cno further proceedings shall be taken in the district court until 60 days after the court has ruled upon the motion,\\u201d 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1292(d)(4)(B). If the district court grants or denies the motion, the Federal Circuit has \\u201cexclusive jurisdiction of an appeal\\u201d from that order. 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1292(d)(4)(A). If there is an appeal, the district court\\u2019s \\u201cproceedings shall be further stayed until the appeal has been decided.\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 1292(d)(4)(B). The district court in this case did not follow this statutory procedure, perhaps because neither Palacios nor the government brought the governing statutes to the court\\u2019s attention. The district court, rather than staying its proceedings, denied Palacios\\u2019s transfer motion, granted the government\\u2019s motion to dismiss, and denied Palacios\\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint. Because the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from orders granting or denying the transfer of an action to the Court of Federal Claims, we dismiss for want of jurisdiction Palacios\\u2019s appeal from that aspect of the district court\\u2019s judgment. See Murthy v. Vilsack, 609 F.3d 460, 461\\u201364 (D.C. Cir. 2010). As to the district court\\u2019s dismissal of the complaint, we agree that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Palacios\\u2019s complaint. The complaint expressly demanded the entry of a judgment including an award of back pay exceeding $10,000. Under the Tucker Act, the Court of Federal Claims therefore had exclusive jurisdiction over this claim. See 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1346(a)(2), 1491(a); Schwalier v. Hagel, 734 F.3d 1218, 1220\\u201322 (D.C. Cir. 2013); Sawyer v. United States, 930 F.2d 1577, 1580\\u201381 (Fed. Cir. 1991); Van Drasek v. Lehman, 762 F.2d 1065, 1067\\u201372 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Palacios argues that primarily his complaint sought to correct his military records and that the essence of his complaint was therefore not monetary. We \\u201clook only to the essence of a complaint in the absence of an explicit request for monetary relief.\\u201d Schwalier, 734 F.3d at 1221. Our decisions examining a complaint\\u2019s essence therefore do not apply. See, e.g., Tootle v. Sec\\u2019y of the Navy, 446 F.3d 167, 169, 173\\u201377 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Kidwell v. Dep\\u2019t of the Army, Bd. for Correction of Military Records, 56 F.3d 279, 284\\u201386 (D.C. Cir. 1995). It follows that the district court correctly dismissed the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., Fisher-Cal Indus., Inc. v. United States, 747 F.3d 899, 902\\u201303 (D.C. Cir. 2014). In opposing the government\\u2019s motion to dismiss, Palacios sought leave to amend his complaint in order to drop his demand for back pay. The district court properly denied his motion. The amendment would have been futile. Aside from the Tucker Act jurisdictional problem, the Board\\u2019s denial of Palacios\\u2019s request for reconsideration is not subject to judicial review because Palacios alleges only \\u201cmaterial error\\u201d in the agency\\u2019s original decision. Sendra Corp. v. Magaw, 111 F.3d 162, 166 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (quoting ICC v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng\\u2019rs, 482 U.S. 270, 279, 107 S.Ct. 2360, 96 L.Ed.2d 222 (1987)). As we explained in Sendra, when an agency merely affirms its original decision in denying a petition for reconsideration, it has not rendered a judicially reviewable decision. Id. at 167. We have recognized two exceptions to this general rule. Neither applies here. First, a denial of reconsideration may be reviewable, albeit under an especially deferential standard of review, when the requesting party raises \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018new evidence\\u2019 or \\u2018changed circumstances.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Sendra, 111 F.3d at 166 (quoting Locomotive Eng\\u2019rs, 482 U.S. at 278, 107 S.Ct. 2360). This is so even when the governing statute or regulation allows for reconsideration on other bases, such as new argument or material error. See Locomotive Eng\\u2019rs, 482 U.S. at 277\\u201378, 107 S.Ct. 2360. Palacios concedes that his request for reconsideration raised only a new argument, so this exception does not apply. Second, courts may review an agency\\u2019s decision if the agency, despite denying reconsideration, \\u201cclearly states or indicates that it has reopened the matter.\\u201d Sendra, 111 F.3d at 167. Otherwise, we do not \\u201clook behind the agency\\u2019s formal disposition of the reconsideration request to see whether the agency \\u2018in fact\\u2019 reopened its original decision.\\u201d Id. (quoting Locomotive Eng\\u2019rs, 482 U.S. at 280, 107 S.Ct. 2360). Here the Corrections Board used boilerplate language in summarily denying Palacios\\u2019s request. This falls far short of the clear indication of reopening required to review an agency\\u2019s denial of reconsideration. The district court lacked jurisdiction over Palacios\\u2019s complaint, and it correctly determined that amendment to cure the jurisdictional defect would have been futile. We therefore dismiss the appeal with respect to the motion to transfer and affirm with respect to the motions to dismiss and for leave to amend. Dismissed in part and affirmed in part.\",\n          \"MEMORANDUM AND ORDER In 2013, defendant pleaded nolo contendere in Pennsylvania to indecent assault, a sexually violent offense, and was sentenced to a prison term of nine months to five years as a consequence of his conduct in subjecting a six-year-old child to sexual contact (see 18 Pa.C.S. \\u00a7 3126[a][7]\\u2009). \\u2002He was released on February 2, 2018, following the maximum expiration of his sentence. \\u2002Upon his relocation to Broome County, the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders prepared a risk assessment instrument that presumptively classified defendant as a risk level two sex offender (100 points) in accordance with the Sex Offender Registration Act (see Correction Law art 6\\u2013C) (see Correction Law \\u00a7\\u00a7 168\\u2013a [2][a][i]; \\u2009[d][i]\\u2009). \\u2002At the risk assessment hearing, the People adopted the Board's risk assessment recommendation and defendant challenged the assessment of points under several risk factors. \\u2002County Court assessed a risk factor score of 100, classified defendant as a risk level two sex offender and denied his request for a downward departure. \\u2002Defendant appeals. Defendant contends that he should not have been assessed 15 points under both risk factor 12, for not accepting responsibility for his conduct and refusing sex offender treatment, and risk factor 14, for release without supervision, and that assessing points under both risk factors constitutes double counting. \\u2002We disagree. \\u2002With regard to risk factor 12, the sex offender guidelines provide that \\u201c[a]n offender who does not accept responsibility for his [or her] conduct or minimizes what occurred is a poor prospect for rehabilitation,\\u201d and that refusal to participate in sex offender treatment is \\u201cpowerful evidence of the offender's continued denial and his [or her] unwillingness to alter his [or her] behavior\\u201d (Sex Offender Registration Act: \\u2009Risk Assessment Guidelines and Commentary at 15\\u201316 [2006]\\u2009). \\u2002The case summary and other reliable documentary evidence established that, when he was interviewed by police, defendant denied the charged conduct and blamed the victim and another child (see People v. DePerno, 165 A.D.3d 1351, 1352, 84 N.Y.S.3d 605 [2018], lv denied 32 N.Y.3d 915, 2019 WL 690310 [2019]). \\u2002Defendant also explicitly \\u201crefused\\u201d treatment while incarcerated (Sex Offender Registration Act: Risk Assessment Guidelines and Commentary at 16 [2006]; \\u2009cf. \\u2002People v. Ford, 25 N.Y.3d 939, 941, 6 N.Y.S.3d 541, 29 N.E.3d 888 [2015]). \\u2002Contrary to his claims, a plea of nolo contendere, like an Alford plea (see North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 [1970]), \\u201cdoes not entail an admission of culpability and, thus, may properly be treated as a refusal to accept responsibility,\\u201d along with other relevant circumstances, for purposes of risk factor 12 (People v. Matthie, 34 A.D.3d 987, 990, 824 N.Y.S.2d 454 [2006], lvs denied 8 N.Y.3d 805, 831 N.Y.S.2d 106, 863 N.E.2d 111, 8 N.Y.3d 847, 830 N.Y.S.2d 706, 862 N.E.2d 798 [2007]; \\u2009see People v. Briggs, 86 A.D.3d 903, 904, 928 N.Y.S.2d 108 [2011]; \\u2009People v. Hazen, 47 A.D.3d 1091, 1092, 850 N.Y.S.2d 267 [2008]; \\u2009see also Matter of Kasckarow v. Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders of State of N.Y., 25 N.Y.3d 1039, 1042, 10 N.Y.S.3d 492, 32 N.E.3d 927 [2015]; \\u2009Matter of Silmon v. Travis, 95 N.Y.2d 470, 474\\u2013477, 718 N.Y.S.2d 704, 741 N.E.2d 501 [2000]). \\u2002In view of the foregoing facts, we find that the record amply supports County Court's conclusion that defendant failed to genuinely accept responsibility for his actions and refused treatment, warranting the assignment of 15 points under risk factor 12 (see People v. Briggs, 86 A.D.3d at 904, 928 N.Y.S.2d 108; \\u2009People v. Mercado, 55 A.D.3d 583, 583\\u2013584, 865 N.Y.S.2d 629 [2008], lv denied 11 N.Y.3d 714, 873 N.Y.S.2d 269, 901 N.E.2d 763 [2008]; \\u2009People v. Brister, 38 A.D.3d 634, 634, 832 N.Y.S.2d 246 [2007], lv denied 8 N.Y.3d 815, 839 N.Y.S.2d 453, 870 N.E.2d 694 [2007]; \\u2009People v. Matthie, 34 A.D.3d at 990, 824 N.Y.S.2d 454). In challenging the assessment of 15 points under risk factor 14, defendant does not dispute that he was released from a Pennsylvania prison without any supervision. \\u2002Rather, his argument is that he was held until the maximum expiration of his sentence and released without supervision solely due to his refusal to participate in a sex offender treatment program and, thus, County Court impermissibly double counted his refusal to participate in treatment under both risk factors 12 and 14. \\u2002However, the purpose of the risk level determination is \\u201cto assess the risk of a repeat offense by [a] sex offender and the threat posed to the public safety\\u201d (Correction Law \\u00a7 168\\u2013l [5]; \\u2009see People v. Mingo, 12 N.Y.3d 563, 571, 883 N.Y.S.2d 154, 910 N.E.2d 983 [2009]) and, to that end, \\u201c[t]he guidelines emphasize the importance of strict supervision to avoid repeat offenses when sex offenders are released into the community\\u201d (People v. Grimm, 107 A.D.3d 1040, 1043, 967 N.Y.S.2d 189 [2013], lv denied 21 N.Y.3d 1042, 972 N.Y.S.2d 540, 995 N.E.2d 856 [2013], citing Sex Offender Registration Act: \\u2009Risk Assessment Guidelines and Commentary at 17 [2006]; \\u2009see People v. Saravia, 154 A.D.3d 1022, 1024, 61 N.Y.S.3d 723 [2017]). \\u2002As there is no dispute that defendant was a convicted sex offender who was released without any supervision, regardless of the reasons for the lack of supervision, he was properly assessed 15 points under this risk factor (see People v. Saravia, 154 A.D.3d at 1024, 61 N.Y.S.3d 723; \\u2009People v. Middlemiss, 153 A.D.3d 1096, 1098, 60 N.Y.S.3d 593 [2017], lv denied 30 N.Y.3d 906, 2017 WL 5615862 [2017]; \\u2009People v. Leeks, 43 A.D.3d 1251, 1252, 842 N.Y.S.2d 613 [2007]). \\u2002There has been no finding that supervision would not reduce defendant's risk of reoffending, and the fact that his refusal to undergo treatment resulted in his later unsupervised release did not reduce his risk of recidivism or constitute an impermissible double counting with regard to factor 12. Although we agree with defendant that the County Court should have applied a preponderance of the evidence standard to defendant's request for a downward departure, remittal is unnecessary as the record is sufficient to enable this Court to review defendant's contentions under the proper standard (see People v. Gillotti, 23 N.Y.3d 841, 845, 861, 994 N.Y.S.2d 1, 18 N.E.3d 701 [2014]; \\u2009People v. Coe, 167 A.D.3d 1175, 1176, 88 N.Y.S.3d 717 [2018]; \\u2009People v. Simons, 157 A.D.3d 1063, 1065, 69 N.Y.S.3d 185 [2018]). \\u2002In seeking a downward departure, it was defendant's burden to demonstrate, \\u201cby a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of mitigating factors not adequately taken into consideration by the risk assessment guidelines\\u201d (People v. Wilson, 167 A.D.3d 1192, 1193, 88 N.Y.S.3d 715 [2018] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]\\u2009). \\u2002Defendant argues that a downward departure was warranted in that, had he been sentenced in New York, he would have received a period of postrelease supervision and, thus, he would not have been assessed 15 points under risk factor 14 for unsupervised release (see Penal Law \\u00a7\\u00a7 70.45 [2\\u2013a]; \\u200970.80[1], [9]\\u2009). \\u2002However, even deducting the 15 points assessed under risk factor 14, defendant would have a total risk score of 85, still a presumptive risk level two sex offender. \\u2002More to the point, the reason for his unsupervised release \\u2014 refusal to participate in sex offender treatment \\u2014 does not minimize his risk of reoffending and is certainly not a mitigating factor. \\u2002Upon our review of the record under the proper standard, we do not find that there were mitigating factors present that were not adequately taken into consideration by the guidelines and, thus, we are satisfied that County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the requested downward departure and in classifying defendant as a risk level two sex offender (see People v. Gillotti, 23 N.Y.3d at 861, 994 N.Y.S.2d 1, 18 N.E.3d 701).  ORDERED that the order is affirmed, without costs.\",\n          \" Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Ellen M. Spodek, J.), dated August 13, 2015. \\u2002The order granted the motions of the respondents for leave to renew and, upon renewal, granted their prior cross motion to vacate an arbitration award. ORDERED that the order is reversed, on the law, with one bill of costs payable by the respondents appearing separately and filing separate briefs, and the respondents' motions for leave to renew their prior cross motion to vacate the arbitration award are denied. Many of the underlying facts are set forth in our decision and order on a related appeal from an order dated November 27, 2012 (see Mew Equity, LLC v. Sutton Land Servs., LLC, 144 A.D.3d 872, 41 N.Y.S.3d 281 [Appellate Division Docket No. 2014\\u201300281; \\u2009decided herewith]\\u2009). In an order dated January 30, 2014, the Supreme Court modified portions of an arbitration award dated August 9, 2012, issued by a rabbinical court (hereinafter the 2012 award), confirmed the 2012 award as so modified, and denied the respondents' cross motion to vacate the 2012 award in its entirety. \\u2002Thereafter, the respondent Mendel Brach moved, and the remaining respondents separately moved, for leave to renew their cross motion to vacate the 2012 award. \\u2002In an order dated August 13, 2015, the court granted leave to renew, and upon renewal, in effect, vacated the prior determination denying the respondents' cross motion to vacate the 2012 award and, thereupon, granted the cross motion and remitted the matter to the rabbinical court for a rehearing and a new determination. \\u2003\\u201c\\u2009\\u2018A motion for leave to renew shall be based upon new facts not offered on the prior motion that would change the prior determination and shall contain reasonable justification for the failure to present such facts on the prior motion\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d (Cioffi v. S.M. Foods, Inc., 129 A.D.3d 888, 890\\u2013891, 10 N.Y.S.3d 620, quoting Lindbergh v. SHLO 54, LLC, 128 A.D.3d 642, 644\\u2013645, 9 N.Y.S.3d 105 [internal quotation marks omitted]; \\u2009see CPLR 2221[e][2], [3]\\u2009). \\u2002The new or additional facts presented \\u201ceither must have not been known to the party seeking renewal or may, in the Supreme Court's discretion, be based on facts known to the party seeking renewal at the time of the original motion\\u201d (Deutsche Bank Trust Co. v. Ghaness, 100 A.D.3d 585, 586, 953 N.Y.S.2d 301; \\u2009see Rowe v. NYCPD, 85 A.D.3d 1001, 1003, 926 N.Y.S.2d 121). \\u2003Here, in support of their renewal motions, the respondents submitted answers to interrogatories obtained in a separate civil action. \\u2002Those answers were given by an attorney who had represented the petitioners in connection with the underlying transactions, and were not available to the respondents at the time they made their cross motion to vacate the 2012 award. \\u2002Contrary to the Supreme Court's determination, the facts adduced from those interrogatory answers were merely cumulative with respect to the factual material submitted in connection with the respondents' cross motion, and did not demonstrate that the petitioners fraudulently concealed material information from the rabbinical court (see Varela v. Clark, 134 A.D.3d 925, 926, 21 N.Y.S.3d 331; \\u2009Yerushalmi v. Yerushalmi, 82 A.D.3d 1217, 1217\\u20131218, 919 N.Y.S.2d 374). \\u2002Consequently, the court should have denied the respondents' motions for leave to renew their cross motion to vacate the 2012 award.
