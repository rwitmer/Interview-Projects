              "\"ORDER OVERRULING DEBTOR'S OBJECTION TO CLAIMS On April 17, 2019 the Court held a hearing on Debtor's Renewed Objections to Proofs of Claims of LVNV Funding, LLC (the “Objection”) (doc. 191) in the above captioned case. Appearances were made on the record. Briefly summarized, the Objection poses the question whether three proofs of claim that were filed within the deadline that unquestionably pertained when the case was converted from one under Chapter 7 to one under Chapter 13, and which was confirmed by an official “Notice” sent out by the Clerk's Office, were nonetheless untimely because an intervening change in the pertinent Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure, which shortened by almost two months the deadline for filing claims, should be applied retroactively. Stated slightly differently, the Court must decide whether it would be “just and practicable” to apply the change in the Rule to this already pending case. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court took the matter under submission. For the reasons set forth below, the Court HEREBY OVERRULES the Objection. In order fully to assess the issues presented, some background is necessary. On September 7, 2017 Debtor filed a chapter 7\\u2009 bankruptcy case. This original filing was done by the Debtor pro se, and without the advice of counsel. It appears that the Debtor did not then understand that, in a Chapter 7 case a trustee would be appointed, whose principal task would be to identify assets of the estate, liquidate them, and pay proceeds to creditors on account of allowed claims. The Debtor owns her residence located at 73 Graegle Ct., Oakland, California (the “Property”), in which she has enough equity to pay all her secured and unsecured claims in full. It was thus apparent that a chapter 7 trustee would have sold the Property to pay allowed claims in the chapter 7 case. Having engaged counsel post-filing, Debtor made the decision to convert her case to one under chapter 13, which would permit her to propose and possibly confirm a plan to pay her creditors, including arrears on any claims secured by the Property, as well as unsecured claims, as allowed. Of greatest importance to Debtor, it would have enabled her to retain the Property, her home. However, of great significance in this matter, because in a chapter 7 case all allowed claims would have been paid in full from the proceeds of sale of the Property, any chapter 13 plan proposed by the Debtor would be required to treat creditors equally well, meaning that the plan would have to ensure that all holders of allowed unsecured claims would be paid in full pursuant to § 1325(a)(4) (better known as the “best interests of creditors test,” stating that a chapter 13 plan may only be confirmed if unsecured creditors receive as much as they would receive under a chapter 7 liquidation). On October 23, 2017, on motion of the Debtor, the case was converted to a chapter 13 bankruptcy. On October 25, 2018, the Court entered a Notice of Chapter 13 Bankruptcy Case, Official Form 309I (the “Notice”) (doc. 23). Pursuant to (and as required by) Rule 2002(f)(3), the Court mailed the Notice, which contained all pertinent deadlines, including the deadline to file proofs of claim, to all creditors listed in Debtor's bankruptcy schedules. The filing deadline for all non-government creditors to file proofs of claim set forth in the Notice was February 28, 2018, in accordance with then-in-effect Rule 3002(c) (“a proof of claim is timely filed if it is not later than 90 days after the first date set for the meeting of creditors”). Also on October 25, 2018, prior to any proof of claim being filed, Debtor filed her first chapter 13 plan (doc. 24). That plan proposed to pay zero-percent of allowed unsecured claims. The Chapter 13 Trustee objected to this plan on the basis that the plan needed to pay all allowed claims, including unsecured claims, in full. The plan eventually confirmed by the Debtor on August 14, 2018 (Debtor's Fourth Amended Plan, doc. 148) provides for the payment of all allowed unsecured claims in full, as it must. On December 1, 2017, an amended version of Rule 3002 took effect, among myriad other Rule amendments. Amended Rule 3002(c) shortens the deadline to file proofs of claim to 70 days after an order for relief is entered or a bankruptcy case is converted. Chief Justice John Roberts' Order transmitting the amendments to Congress stated “the foregoing amendments to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure shall take effect on December 1, 2017 and shall govern in all proceedings in bankruptcy cases thereafter commenced and, insofar as just and practicable, all proceedings then pending.” (Transmittal of 2017 Federal Bankruptcy Rule Amendments from Supreme Court to Congress, at 3) (emphasis added). On February 27, 2018 LVNV filed three proofs of unsecured claim, totaling, in the aggregate, approximately $1500. These claims were acquired by LVNV from Capitol One Bank, N.A. and Arrow Financial Services, LLC. It thus appears that these claims are credit card debts. Debtor objects to these general unsecured claims on the basis that the claims were untimely filed, because the bar date for the filing of claims pursuant to amended Rule 3002(c) was January 1, 2018. Debtor has not objected to the claims based on any other ground. LVNV defends the timeliness of its filings, arguing that it would not be “just and practicable” for the Court to apply amended Rule 3002(c) effectively to shorten by fifty-eight days the deadline duly set by the Court to file proofs of claim on this chapter 13 case. It is Neither Just nor Practicable to Apply Amended Rule 3002(c) in Debtor's Case. Courts within the Ninth Circuit that have addressed the question of whether application of an amended Rule of Civil or Criminal Procedure would be “just and practicable” have done so on a case-by-case basis. See United States v. Pangang Group Co., No. 11-cr-00573-JSW, 2017 WL 3034063 at *6 (N.D. Cal. Jul. 18, 2017) (just and practicable to apply amended Fed. R. Crim. P. 4 to pending case because defendants had actual notice of indictment for years but had evaded service due to deficiencies of former Rule 4 which were corrected by the amended Rule); United States v. Woods, No. 05-10494, 173 F.App'x. 631 (9th Cir. 2006) (not abuse of discretion to find it was just and practicable to apply amended Fed. R. Crim. P. 33 when defendant had more than 31 months to file relevant motion under amended Rule's deadline); United States v. Ross, 372 F.3d 1097, 1105 & n. 6 (9th Cir. 2004) (not abuse of discretion to find it was not just and practicable to apply amended Fed. R. Crim. P. 33 when defendant's filing deadline would have been drastically shortened under the amended Rule's deadline). Taking direction from the analysis in these cases, the Court will first determine whether it is just and practicable to apply amended Rule 3002 to Debtor's case. However, because of the unique administrative function of the bankruptcy courts within the claims administration process, the Court will then briefly examine whether it is just and practicable to apply amended Rule 3002 to cases pending as of December 1, 2019 on a more generalized, institutional basis. As noted above, Chief Justice Roberts' Transmittal Order to Congress stated that the amended Rules were to be applied to then-pending cases “insofar as just and practicable.” The Ninth Circuit noted in a case analyzing amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure that “[t]his language is not unique--it has been submitted by the Supreme Court with nearly all amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure--and indicates the intent that the rules be applied to pending cases only if such application would be ‘just and practicable.’\\u2009” The Court notes that amendments to Rules go into effect annually on December 1, and that in any given year, there are amendments to numerous Rules. For instance, the Transmittal Order amending Rule 3002 also amended Rules 2002, 3007, 3012, 3015, 4003, 5009, 7001, and 9009. Application of some of these amended Rules (such as Rule 7001, governing the types of issues to be brought via adversary proceeding) would have minimal to no effect on pending cases, while application of other amended Rules may have a large impact on pending cases. In her papers and during oral argument, Debtor argued that any amendment to the Rules must take effect immediately and without limitation—in essence, that counsel (and presumably, parties) are charged with notice of any Rules amendments (whether such amendments are officially recognized as being applicable to pending cases or not) and must “act accordingly.” Notwithstanding the apparent inflexibility of this position, Debtor urges the Court to conclude that any prior informal notice (including, presumably, deemed notice) of Rule amendments provides, by itself, and with no consideration for any other factor or circumstance, all of the “just-ness and practicable-ness” necessary to make amendments universally, immediately and retroactively effective. But this unyielding, one-size-fits-all interpretation would read the phrase “insofar as is just and practicable” completely out from the Chief Justice's direction, and would prohibit courts from exercising the discretion, in applying Rule changes to pending cases, that the Chief Justice's message has consistently indicated they should apply. In directing courts to apply the amended Rules insofar as is “just and practicable” to pending cases, Chief Justice Roberts clearly gave courts discretion to evaluate the impact of applying the amended Rules to pending cases. Neither the Supreme Court nor the Ninth Circuit have directly addressed the appropriate interpretation of the phrase “just and practicable.” The Court considers the words below. First, the Court understands the word “just” to mean, in this context, basic fairness to all parties involved in the bankruptcy system. Inherent to such basic fairness is the concept that a Rule should not unduly burden debtors to the advantage creditors, or vice versa. It would be unduly burdensome to LVNV to decide that LVNV's proof of claim filing deadline was actually fifty-eight days fewer than a deadline provided by the Court, pursuant to a required and official “Notice” on which LVNV relied. Basic fairness also means treating creditors within a case similarly and equitably. Debtor's prior conduct in this case demonstrates no fidelity to this objective. In a circumstance in which it clearly benefitted her to do so, Debtor stipulated to allow a late filed (March 2, 2018, two days after the officially noticed deadline) secured claim of creditor Sequoyah Heights Homeowners' Association. (Stipulation to Allow Creditor Sequoyah Heights Homeowners Association's Late Proof of Claim, doc. 73). Debtor was willing to indulge Sequoyah in a late-filed claim issue because, as a secured creditor, Sequoyah's lien would not have been discharged, and would have burdened the Property even after Debtor completed her plan and received a discharge. To permit Debtor to choose to allow a late-filed claim (which was late-filed by the standards of both former and amended Rule 3002(c)) while also permitting Debtor to object to and disallow an earlier filed unsecured claim would not be just under the circumstances of this case. Second, the Court understands the word “practicable” to mean “reasonably capable of being accomplished; [or] feasible in a particular situation.” (Practicable, Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014)). The practicability of applying amended Rule 3002(c) must be considered within the context of the role of the Court within the bankruptcy system. As opposed to litigation, in which a court oversees disputes between litigants, in bankruptcy the Clerk's Office and to some extent, the court also perform administrative roles. The chapter 13 process begins with a debtor filing a case and a plan and ends with either dismissal, conversion to a case under a different chapter of the Code, or plan completion. The filing and allowance or disallowance of claims is a principal function of this system. The critical first step a general unsecured creditor must take to ensure its valid debt is entitled to treatment under a plan is to timely file a proof of claim. Because adherence to the deadline associated with filing proofs of claim is essential for unsecured creditors seeking to maintain their rights to repayment, Rule 2002 mandates the Clerk of Court to “send notice by mail of ․ the time allowed for filing claims pursuant to Rule 3002” on 21 days' notice to creditors. This requirement is critical because it transforms a deadline from an abstract concept (e.g., within 70 days of case filing or conversion) to a date certain (e.g., February 28, 2018), thereby enabling creditors simply and efficiently to comply with the deadline. Rule 2002 demonstrates the centrality of the Court's role is within the proof of claim filing process. To decide at a later stage of a case that a deadline duly noticed out by the Clerk's Office, that creditors duly relied upon, was changed automatically so as to remove fifty-eight days from a filing deadline, without further notice to Debtor or creditors from the Clerk of Court as mandated by Rule 2002, is simply not practicable. And to decide that an amended rule applies to a pending case when the only effect of application is to disallow otherwise meritorious claims is not just. Debtor also argues that it is just and practicable to apply amended Rule 3002(c) retroactively because the policy behind any filing deadline for proofs of claim is to prevent the unraveling of “the debtor's carefully constructed plan of reorganization to the detriment of the creditors who showed up on time ․” (Debtor's Reply Brief, doc. 199 at 3). The Court does not find this argument credible on the facts of this case. As noted above, Debtor carefully crafted and filed a Chapter 13 plan prior to any creditor “showing up” by way of filing a proof of claim. While Debtor's first plan attempted to pay zero-percent of unsecured claims, Debtor's later plans accepted that in order to satisfy the requirements of § 1325(a)(4), all allowed general unsecured claims would have to be paid in full. The relevant claims question in a case where all unsecured creditors are to be paid in full is whether Debtor has enough disposable income to pay the allowed claims--as opposed to the perhaps more common scenario in which Debtor must carefully craft a plan which pays cents on the dollar to various unsecured creditors, and a late-filed claim would require the Debtor to go back to the drawing board, divvying up her disposable income slightly differently, and cause timely-filing creditors to take an even smaller slice of pie to accommodate a latecomer if such claim were to be allowed. These issues which Debtor attempts to invoke as reason to disallow the claim are simply not applicable to Debtor's 100% plan. Based on the disposition of the case, it appears not that Debtor was blind sided by late filing creditors, but instead that Debtor attempted to blind side unwary creditors that filed proofs of claim according to the deadline set forth by the Court upon conversion of Debtor's case. It is Neither Just nor Practicable to Apply Amended Rule 3002(c) to Any Case Pending as of December 1, 2017. Moreover, it would not have been practicable for the Court to apply amended Rule 3002(c) to any or all cases pending as of December 1, 2017. Were the Court to apply the amended Rule to any then-pending case, the Court would have had to re-comply with the notice and mailing requirements of Rule 2002(a) and (h) as discussed above. At least 937 then-pending chapter 13 cases in which the deadline to file proofs of claim had not yet run on December 1, 2017 (this number does not include pending cases which had been converted to chapter 13, such as Debtor's case). To apply amended Rule 3002(c), the Clerk of Court would have had to prepare and send out Notices that drastically shorten pre-set filing deadlines, to all creditors listed in more than 937 proceedings. The immense time and cost of such an endeavor places the application of amended Rule 3002 to then-pending cases squarely in the realm of the impracticable. If amended Rule 3002(c) were to apply, as Debtor wishes, to all cases retroactively, in some cases the shortening of the deadline would have been more drastic than Debtor's case. For all of the foregoing reasons, the Debtor's Objection is overruled. IT IS SO ORDERED.\""

The district court, after determining that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, dismissed Palacios\\u2019s complaint, denied his motion for leave to amend the complaint, and rejected his motion to transfer the case to the United States Court of Federal Claims. Palacios v. Spencer, 267 F.Supp.3d 1 (D.D.C. 2017). Palacios appeals each of the district court\\u2019s rulings. Palacios served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1992 to 1995. He received an other-than-honorable discharge stemming from his pattern of misconduct. In about 2002 and 2009, he sought an upgrade of his discharge on the basis that his misconduct resulted from his mental and physical disabilities. The Naval Discharge Review Board denied both of his requests. Palacios then asked the Board for Correction of Naval Records to correct his records. The Correction Board denied his request in 2010. In response, Palacios filed an action for judicial review of the Correction Board\\u2019s decision in the Court of Federal Claims. The Claims Court dismissed his suit as untimely under the statute of limitations applicable to his wrongful-discharge claim. Palacios v. United States, 100 Fed.Cl. 656 (2011). The Federal Circuit affirmed. Palacios v. United States, No. 2012-5028, 2012 WL 2415348 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 8, 2012) (per curiam) (unpublished order). This appeal arises from Palacios\\u2019s request that the Correction Board reconsider its decision. After the Board denied this request in 2015, Palacios filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. He claimed that the Board\\u2019s denial of reconsideration was arbitrary and capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, and contrary to law under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2). His prayer for relief asked the district court to enter judgment correcting his disability rating and discharge, awarding costs and attorneys\\u2019 fees, and \\u201c[g]ranting Plaintiff appropriate back pay and benefits that would natural[ly] flow from the upgrade in discharge status.\\u201d In the alternative, he asked the district court to remand to the Correction Board for consideration on the merits. The government moved to dismiss on the ground that Palacios\\u2019s complaint fell outside the applicable statute of limitations and that it asserted a claim under the Tucker Act over which the Court of Federal Claims had exclusive jurisdiction. In his opposition to the government\\u2019s motion to dismiss, Palacios moved for leave to amend his complaint by dropping his request for money damages or, in the alternative, to transfer the case to the Court of Federal Claims. When a party in the district court moves to transfer the case to the Court of Federal Claims, see 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1631, a statutory procedure is triggered: \\u201cno further proceedings shall be taken in the district court until 60 days after the court has ruled upon the motion,\\u201d 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1292(d)(4)(B). If the district court grants or denies the motion, the Federal Circuit has \\u201cexclusive jurisdiction of an appeal\\u201d from that order. 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1292(d)(4)(A). If there is an appeal, the district court\\u2019s \\u201cproceedings shall be further stayed until the appeal has been decided.\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 1292(d)(4)(B). The district court in this case did not follow this statutory procedure, perhaps because neither Palacios nor the government brought the governing statutes to the court\\u2019s attention. The district court, rather than staying its proceedings, denied Palacios\\u2019s transfer motion, granted the government\\u2019s motion to dismiss, and denied Palacios\\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint. Because the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from orders granting or denying the transfer of an action to the Court of Federal Claims, we dismiss for want of jurisdiction Palacios\\u2019s appeal from that aspect of the district court\\u2019s judgment. See Murthy v. Vilsack, 609 F.3d 460, 461\\u201364 (D.C. Cir. 2010). As to the district court\\u2019s dismissal of the complaint, we agree that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Palacios\\u2019s complaint. The complaint expressly demanded the entry of a judgment including an award of back pay exceeding $10,000. Under the Tucker Act, the Court of Federal Claims therefore had exclusive jurisdiction over this claim. See 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1346(a)(2), 1491(a); Schwalier v. Hagel, 734 F.3d 1218, 1220\\u201322 (D.C. Cir. 2013); Sawyer v. United States, 930 F.2d 1577, 1580\\u201381 (Fed. Cir. 1991); Van Drasek v. Lehman, 762 F.2d 1065, 1067\\u201372 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Palacios argues that primarily his complaint sought to correct his military records and that the essence of his complaint was therefore not monetary. We \\u201clook only to the essence of a complaint in the absence of an explicit request for monetary relief.\\u201d Schwalier, 734 F.3d at 1221. Our decisions examining a complaint\\u2019s essence therefore do not apply. See, e.g., Tootle v. Sec\\u2019y of the Navy, 446 F.3d 167, 169, 173\\u201377 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Kidwell v. Dep\\u2019t of the Army, Bd. for Correction of Military Records, 56 F.3d 279, 284\\u201386 (D.C. Cir. 1995). It follows that the district court correctly dismissed the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., Fisher-Cal Indus., Inc. v. United States, 747 F.3d 899, 902\\u201303 (D.C. Cir. 2014). In opposing the government\\u2019s motion to dismiss, Palacios sought leave to amend his complaint in order to drop his demand for back pay. The district court properly denied his motion. The amendment would have been futile. Aside from the Tucker Act jurisdictional problem, the Board\\u2019s denial of Palacios\\u2019s request for reconsideration is not subject to judicial review because Palacios alleges only \\u201cmaterial error\\u201d in the agency\\u2019s original decision. Sendra Corp. v. Magaw, 111 F.3d 162, 166 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (quoting ICC v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng\\u2019rs, 482 U.S. 270, 279, 107 S.Ct. 2360, 96 L.Ed.2d 222 (1987)). As we explained in Sendra, when an agency merely affirms its original decision in denying a petition for reconsideration, it has not rendered a judicially reviewable decision. Id. at 167. We have recognized two exceptions to this general rule. Neither applies here. First, a denial of reconsideration may be reviewable, albeit under an especially deferential standard of review, when the requesting party raises \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018new evidence\\u2019 or \\u2018changed circumstances.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Sendra, 111 F.3d at 166 (quoting Locomotive Eng\\u2019rs, 482 U.S. at 278, 107 S.Ct. 2360). This is so even when the governing statute or regulation allows for reconsideration on other bases, such as new argument or material error. See Locomotive Eng\\u2019rs, 482 U.S. at 277\\u201378, 107 S.Ct. 2360. Palacios concedes that his request for reconsideration raised only a new argument, so this exception does not apply. Second, courts may review an agency\\u2019s decision if the agency, despite denying reconsideration, \\u201cclearly states or indicates that it has reopened the matter.\\u201d Sendra, 111 F.3d at 167. Otherwise, we do not \\u201clook behind the agency\\u2019s formal disposition of the reconsideration request to see whether the agency \\u2018in fact\\u2019 reopened its original decision.\\u201d Id. (quoting Locomotive Eng\\u2019rs, 482 U.S. at 280, 107 S.Ct. 2360). Here the Corrections Board used boilerplate language in summarily denying Palacios\\u2019s request. This falls far short of the clear indication of reopening required to review an agency\\u2019s denial of reconsideration. The district court lacked jurisdiction over Palacios\\u2019s complaint, and it correctly determined that amendment to cure the jurisdictional defect would have been futile. We therefore dismiss the appeal with respect to the motion to transfer and affirm with respect to the motions to dismiss and for leave to amend. Dismissed in part and affirmed in part.\",\n          \"MEMORANDUM AND ORDER In 2013, defendant pleaded nolo contendere in Pennsylvania to indecent assault, a sexually violent offense, and was sentenced to a prison term of nine months to five years as a consequence of his conduct in subjecting a six-year-old child to sexual contact (see 18 Pa.C.S. \\u00a7 3126[a][7]\\u2009). \\u2002He was released on February 2, 2018, following the maximum expiration of his sentence. \\u2002Upon his relocation to Broome County, the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders prepared a risk assessment instrument that presumptively classified defendant as a risk level two sex offender (100 points) in accordance with the Sex Offender Registration Act (see Correction Law art 6\\u2013C) (see Correction Law \\u00a7\\u00a7 168\\u2013a [2][a][i]; \\u2009[d][i]\\u2009). \\u2002At the risk assessment hearing, the People adopted the Board's risk assessment recommendation and defendant challenged the assessment of points under several risk factors. \\u2002County Court assessed a risk factor score of 100, classified defendant as a risk level two sex offender and denied his request for a downward departure. \\u2002Defendant appeals. Defendant contends that he should not have been assessed 15 points under both risk factor 12, for not accepting responsibility for his conduct and refusing sex offender treatment, and risk factor 14, for release without supervision, and that assessing points under both risk factors constitutes double counting. \\u2002We disagree. \\u2002With regard to risk factor 12, the sex offender guidelines provide that \\u201c[a]n offender who does not accept responsibility for his [or her] conduct or minimizes what occurred is a poor prospect for rehabilitation,\\u201d and that refusal to participate in sex offender treatment is \\u201cpowerful evidence of the offender's continued denial and his [or her] unwillingness to alter his [or her] behavior\\u201d (Sex Offender Registration Act: \\u2009Risk Assessment Guidelines and Commentary at 15\\u201316 [2006]\\u2009). \\u2002The case summary and other reliable documentary evidence established that, when he was interviewed by police, defendant denied the charged conduct and blamed the victim and another child (see People v. DePerno, 165 A.D.3d 1351, 1352, 84 N.Y.S.3d 605 [2018], lv denied 32 N.Y.3d 915, 2019 WL 690310 [2019]). \\u2002Defendant also explicitly \\u201crefused\\u201d treatment while incarcerated (Sex Offender Registration Act: Risk Assessment Guidelines and Commentary at 16 [2006]; \\u2009cf. \\u2002People v. Ford, 25 N.Y.3d 939, 941, 6 N.Y.S.3d 541, 29 N.E.3d 888 [2015]). \\u2002Contrary to his claims, a plea of nolo contendere, like an Alford plea (see North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 [1970]), \\u201cdoes not entail an admission of culpability and, thus, may properly be treated as a refusal to accept responsibility,\\u201d along with other relevant circumstances, for purposes of risk factor 12 (People v. Matthie, 34 A.D.3d 987, 990, 824 N.Y.S.2d 454 [2006], lvs denied 8 N.Y.3d 805, 831 N.Y.S.2d 106, 863 N.E.2d 111, 8 N.Y.3d 847, 830 N.Y.S.2d 706, 862 N.E.2d 798 [2007]; \\u2009see People v. Briggs, 86 A.D.3d 903, 904, 928 N.Y.S.2d 108 [2011]; \\u2009People v. Hazen, 47 A.D.3d 1091, 1092, 850 N.Y.S.2d 267 [2008]; \\u2009see also Matter of Kasckarow v. Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders of State of N.Y., 25 N.Y.3d 1039, 1042, 10 N.Y.S.3d 492, 32 N.E.3d 927 [2015]; \\u2009Matter of Silmon v. Travis, 95 N.Y.2d 470, 474\\u2013477, 718 N.Y.S.2d 704, 741 N.E.2d 501 [2000]). \\u2002In view of the foregoing facts, we find that the record amply supports County Court's conclusion that defendant failed to genuinely accept responsibility for his actions and refused treatment, warranting the assignment of 15 points under risk factor 12 (see People v. Briggs, 86 A.D.3d at 904, 928 N.Y.S.2d 108; \\u2009People v. Mercado, 55 A.D.3d 583, 583\\u2013584, 865 N.Y.S.2d 629 [2008], lv denied 11 N.Y.3d 714, 873 N.Y.S.2d 269, 901 N.E.2d 763 [2008]; \\u2009People v. Brister, 38 A.D.3d 634, 634, 832 N.Y.S.2d 246 [2007], lv denied 8 N.Y.3d 815, 839 N.Y.S.2d 453, 870 N.E.2d 694 [2007]; \\u2009People v. Matthie, 34 A.D.3d at 990, 824 N.Y.S.2d 454). In challenging the assessment of 15 points under risk factor 14, defendant does not dispute that he was released from a Pennsylvania prison without any supervision. \\u2002Rather, his argument is that he was held until the maximum expiration of his sentence and released without supervision solely due to his refusal to participate in a sex offender treatment program and, thus, County Court impermissibly double counted his refusal to participate in treatment under both risk factors 12 and 14. \\u2002However, the purpose of the risk level determination is \\u201cto assess the risk of a repeat offense by [a] sex offender and the threat posed to the public safety\\u201d (Correction Law \\u00a7 168\\u2013l [5]; \\u2009see People v. Mingo, 12 N.Y.3d 563, 571, 883 N.Y.S.2d 154, 910 N.E.2d 983 [2009]) and, to that end, \\u201c[t]he guidelines emphasize the importance of strict supervision to avoid repeat offenses when sex offenders are released into the community\\u201d (People v. Grimm, 107 A.D.3d 1040, 1043, 967 N.Y.S.2d 189 [2013], lv denied 21 N.Y.3d 1042, 972 N.Y.S.2d 540, 995 N.E.2d 856 [2013], citing Sex Offender Registration Act: \\u2009Risk Assessment Guidelines and Commentary at 17 [2006]; \\u2009see People v. Saravia, 154 A.D.3d 1022, 1024, 61 N.Y.S.3d 723 [2017]). \\u2002As there is no dispute that defendant was a convicted sex offender who was released without any supervision, regardless of the reasons for the lack of supervision, he was properly assessed 15 points under this risk factor (see People v. Saravia, 154 A.D.3d at 1024, 61 N.Y.S.3d 723; \\u2009People v. Middlemiss, 153 A.D.3d 1096, 1098, 60 N.Y.S.3d 593 [2017], lv denied 30 N.Y.3d 906, 2017 WL 5615862 [2017]; \\u2009People v. Leeks, 43 A.D.3d 1251, 1252, 842 N.Y.S.2d 613 [2007]). \\u2002There has been no finding that supervision would not reduce defendant's risk of reoffending, and the fact that his refusal to undergo treatment resulted in his later unsupervised release did not reduce his risk of recidivism or constitute an impermissible double counting with regard to factor 12. Although we agree with defendant that the County Court should have applied a preponderance of the evidence standard to defendant's request for a downward departure, remittal is unnecessary as the record is sufficient to enable this Court to review defendant's contentions under the proper standard (see People v. Gillotti, 23 N.Y.3d 841, 845, 861, 994 N.Y.S.2d 1, 18 N.E.3d 701 [2014]; \\u2009People v. Coe, 167 A.D.3d 1175, 1176, 88 N.Y.S.3d 717 [2018]; \\u2009People v. Simons, 157 A.D.3d 1063, 1065, 69 N.Y.S.3d 185 [2018]). \\u2002In seeking a downward departure, it was defendant's burden to demonstrate, \\u201cby a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of mitigating factors not adequately taken into consideration by the risk assessment guidelines\\u201d (People v. Wilson, 167 A.D.3d 1192, 1193, 88 N.Y.S.3d 715 [2018] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]\\u2009). \\u2002Defendant argues that a downward departure was warranted in that, had he been sentenced in New York, he would have received a period of postrelease supervision and, thus, he would not have been assessed 15 points under risk factor 14 for unsupervised release (see Penal Law \\u00a7\\u00a7 70.45 [2\\u2013a]; \\u200970.80[1], [9]\\u2009). \\u2002However, even deducting the 15 points assessed under risk factor 14, defendant would have a total risk score of 85, still a presumptive risk level two sex offender. \\u2002More to the point, the reason for his unsupervised release \\u2014 refusal to participate in sex offender treatment \\u2014 does not minimize his risk of reoffending and is certainly not a mitigating factor. \\u2002Upon our review of the record under the proper standard, we do not find that there were mitigating factors present that were not adequately taken into consideration by the guidelines and, thus, we are satisfied that County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the requested downward departure and in classifying defendant as a risk level two sex offender (see People v. Gillotti, 23 N.Y.3d at 861, 994 N.Y.S.2d 1, 18 N.E.3d 701).  ORDERED that the order is affirmed, without costs.\",\n          \" Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Ellen M. Spodek, J.), dated August 13, 2015. \\u2002The order granted the motions of the respondents for leave to renew and, upon renewal, granted their prior cross motion to vacate an arbitration award. ORDERED that the order is reversed, on the law, with one bill of costs payable by the respondents appearing separately and filing separate briefs, and the respondents' motions for leave to renew their prior cross motion to vacate the arbitration award are denied. Many of the underlying facts are set forth in our decision and order on a related appeal from an order dated November 27, 2012 (see Mew Equity, LLC v. Sutton Land Servs., LLC, 144 A.D.3d 872, 41 N.Y.S.3d 281 [Appellate Division Docket No. 2014\\u201300281; \\u2009decided herewith]\\u2009). In an order dated January 30, 2014, the Supreme Court modified portions of an arbitration award dated August 9, 2012, issued by a rabbinical court (hereinafter the 2012 award), confirmed the 2012 award as so modified, and denied the respondents' cross motion to vacate the 2012 award in its entirety. \\u2002Thereafter, the respondent Mendel Brach moved, and the remaining respondents separately moved, for leave to renew their cross motion to vacate the 2012 award. \\u2002In an order dated August 13, 2015, the court granted leave to renew, and upon renewal, in effect, vacated the prior determination denying the respondents' cross motion to vacate the 2012 award and, thereupon, granted the cross motion and remitted the matter to the rabbinical court for a rehearing and a new determination. \\u2003\\u201c\\u2009\\u2018A motion for leave to renew shall be based upon new facts not offered on the prior motion that would change the prior determination and shall contain reasonable justification for the failure to present such facts on the prior motion\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d (Cioffi v.

Ghaness, 100 A.D.3d 585, 586, 953 N.Y.S.2d 301; \\u2009see Rowe v. NYCPD, 85 A.D.3d 1001, 1003, 926 N.Y.S.2d 121). \\u2003Here, in support of their renewal motions, the respondents submitted answers to interrogatories obtained in a separate civil action. \\u2002Those answers were given by an attorney who had represented the petitioners in connection with the underlying transactions, and were not available to the respondents at the time they made their cross motion to vacate the 2012 award. \\u2002Contrary to the Supreme Court's determination, the facts adduced from those interrogatory answers were merely cumulative with respect to the factual material submitted in connection with the respondents' cross motion, and did not demonstrate that the petitioners fraudulently concealed material information from the rabbinical court (see Varela v. Clark, 134 A.D.3d 925, 926, 21 N.Y.S.3d 331; \\u2009Yerushalmi v.

Husband agrees with this finding, since it would be to his benefit, except that the trial court also used the 401K as a factor justifying the unequal distribution. Wife agrees the trial court did not have sufficient evidence to value the 401K, but she argues that it need not be valued to be a distributional factor. She is correct that the trial court need not value items used as distributional factors. See Gum v. Gum, 107 N.C.

But we are concerned that the trial court’s finding might be based upon the erroneous date of separation in the order. There was evidence, in the form of a letter from the 401K plan administrator, MassMutual Retirement Services Division, of the vested balance of the 401K as of 31 October 2009, the month of the parties’ separation. Yet the trial court found the parties separated in October 2007. The trial court would be correct there was no evidence of the value of the 401K in 2007—but that is not the relevant year because the parties did not separate until 2009. Wife contends the finding of the year 2007 is merely a non-prejudicial clerical error. But considering the trial court’s finding of a lack of evidence of the value of the 401K as of the date of separation, along with the evidence of a letter from the 401K plan administrator valuing the plan as of the date of separation, we cannot say for sure the date error is nonprejudicial. Again, it is possible the trial court did not rely upon the 401K plan administrator’s letter for some other reason, and that would be within the trial court’s discretion, but since we are vacating this order for other reasons, on remand, the trial court should clarify its findings regarding the valuation of the 401K as of the date of separation or its inability to value the plan.']},\n",

First, neither of these marital assets was valued, as discussed above. The second problem is either a serious clerical error or a misunderstanding of the meaning of the term “liquid.” Black’s Law Dictionary defines a liquid asset as “[a]n asset that is readily convertible to cash, such as a marketable security, a note, or an account receivable.” Black’s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). In comparison, an illiquid asset is defined as “[a]n asset that is not readily convertible into cash, usu. because of (1) the lack of demand, (2) the absence of an established market, or (3) the substantial cost or time required for liquidation (such as real property, even when it is desirable).” Illiquid asset, Black’s Law Dictionary (10th Ed. 2014) (emphasis added). A 401K plan is not liquid since it is not readily accessible and any withdrawals prior to retirement incur substantial taxes and penalties. Equity in a home is not liquid because the home must be sold to get access to the equity. See e.g., Robertson v. Robertson, 167 N.C. App. 567, 571, 605 S.E.2d 667, 669-70 (2004) (“Although the trial court found defendant could liquidate the above assets to pay the $52,100.07 distributive award, the only liquid assets readily available to pay the award were two bank accounts totaling $5,929.38. Wife’s other assets included stock in PSI valued at $37,336.00, the unencumbered one-half acre lot valued at $8,920.00, and the personal property valued at $13,829.68. With the exception of the pension plan, which the trial court found would be difficult to liquidate and might cause unfavorable tax consequences, the trial court failed to make findings concerning the difficulty and possible financial and tax consequences of borrowing money against or liquidating the PSI stock, the one-half acre lot, and the personal property in order to pay the amount of the judgment lien within ninety days. Accordingly, although Wife may in fact be able to pay the distributive award, her evidence is sufficient to raise the question of whether adjusting the award from her to Husband is necessary to offset any adverse financial consequences of using the non-liquid assets.” (Citations, quotation marks, brackets, and ellipses omitted)\\u2009).',\n",
              "   'As discussed above on valuation, the remainder of the finding on factor (i) is also erroneous because the marital property was not valued. The trial court found it could not value the marital equity in the home or the 401K plan. It found there was “no sufficient and competent evidence to value [Husband]’s 401K” and that the exact amount of principal remaining on the HELOC and the equity in the marital residence were also unknown. Without valuation of the marital assets, it is impossible to say if a distribution is equal or unequal. See generally Crowder v. Crowder, 147 N.C. App. 677, 681, 556 S.E.2d 639, 642 (2001) (“The distribution of marital assets entails the court’s determination of an ‘equitable’ division of marital property. The marital property is to be distributed equally, unless the court determines equal is not equitable.” (Citation and quotation marks omitted)\\u2009).

Both parties are limited in what they may do for employment although [Husband] continues to work.” These factors are essentially descriptions of the parties’ circumstances and while they are relevant, they cannot, standing alone, support the trial court’s conclusion that an unequal distribution is equitable.

The district court, after determining that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, dismissed Palacios\\u2019s complaint, denied his motion for leave to amend the complaint, and rejected his motion to transfer the case to the United States Court of Federal Claims. Palacios v. Spencer, 267 F.Supp.3d 1 (D.D.C. 2017). Palacios appeals each of the district court\\u2019s rulings. Palacios served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1992 to 1995. He received an other-than-honorable discharge stemming from his pattern of misconduct. In about 2002 and 2009, he sought an upgrade of his discharge on the basis that his misconduct resulted from his mental and physical disabilities. The Naval Discharge Review Board denied both of his requests. Palacios then asked the Board for Correction of Naval Records to correct his records. The Correction Board denied his request in 2010. In response, Palacios filed an action for judicial review of the Correction Board\\u2019s decision in the Court of Federal Claims. The Claims Court dismissed his suit as untimely under the statute of limitations applicable to his wrongful-discharge claim. Palacios v. United States, 100 Fed.Cl. 656 (2011). The Federal Circuit affirmed. Palacios v. United States, No. 2012-5028, 2012 WL 2415348 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 8, 2012) (per curiam) (unpublished order). This appeal arises from Palacios\\u2019s request that the Correction Board reconsider its decision. After the Board denied this request in 2015, Palacios filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. He claimed that the Board\\u2019s denial of reconsideration was arbitrary and capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, and contrary to law under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2). His prayer for relief asked the district court to enter judgment correcting his disability rating and discharge, awarding costs and attorneys\\u2019 fees, and \\u201c[g]ranting Plaintiff appropriate back pay and benefits that would natural[ly] flow from the upgrade in discharge status.\\u201d In the alternative, he asked the district court to remand to the Correction Board for consideration on the merits. The government moved to dismiss on the ground that Palacios\\u2019s complaint fell outside the applicable statute of limitations and that it asserted a claim under the Tucker Act over which the Court of Federal Claims had exclusive jurisdiction. In his opposition to the government\\u2019s motion to dismiss, Palacios moved for leave to amend his complaint by dropping his request for money damages or, in the alternative, to transfer the case to the Court of Federal Claims. When a party in the district court moves to transfer the case to the Court of Federal Claims, see 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1631, a statutory procedure is triggered: \\u201cno further proceedings shall be taken in the district court until 60 days after the court has ruled upon the motion,\\u201d 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1292(d)(4)(B). If the district court grants or denies the motion, the Federal Circuit has \\u201cexclusive jurisdiction of an appeal\\u201d from that order. 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1292(d)(4)(A). If there is an appeal, the district court\\u2019s \\u201cproceedings shall be further stayed until the appeal has been decided.\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 1292(d)(4)(B). The district court in this case did not follow this statutory procedure, perhaps because neither Palacios nor the government brought the governing statutes to the court\\u2019s attention. The district court, rather than staying its proceedings, denied Palacios\\u2019s transfer motion, granted the government\\u2019s motion to dismiss, and denied Palacios\\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint. Because the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from orders granting or denying the transfer of an action to the Court of Federal Claims, we dismiss for want of jurisdiction Palacios\\u2019s appeal from that aspect of the district court\\u2019s judgment. See Murthy v. Vilsack, 609 F.3d 460, 461\\u201364 (D.C. Cir. 2010). As to the district court\\u2019s dismissal of the complaint, we agree that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Palacios\\u2019s complaint. The complaint expressly demanded the entry of a judgment including an award of back pay exceeding $10,000. Under the Tucker Act, the Court of Federal Claims therefore had exclusive jurisdiction over this claim. See 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1346(a)(2), 1491(a); Schwalier v. Hagel, 734 F.3d 1218, 1220\\u201322 (D.C. Cir. 2013); Sawyer v. United States, 930 F.2d 1577, 1580\\u201381 (Fed. Cir. 1991); Van Drasek v. Lehman, 762 F.2d 1065, 1067\\u201372 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Palacios argues that primarily his complaint sought to correct his military records and that the essence of his complaint was therefore not monetary. We \\u201clook only to the essence of a complaint in the absence of an explicit request for monetary relief.\\u201d Schwalier, 734 F.3d at 1221. Our decisions examining a complaint\\u2019s essence therefore do not apply. See, e.g., Tootle v. Sec\\u2019y of the Navy, 446 F.3d 167, 169, 173\\u201377 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Kidwell v. Dep\\u2019t of the Army, Bd. for Correction of Military Records, 56 F.3d 279, 284\\u201386 (D.C. Cir. 1995). It follows that the district court correctly dismissed the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., Fisher-Cal Indus., Inc. v. United States, 747 F.3d 899, 902\\u201303 (D.C. Cir. 2014). In opposing the government\\u2019s motion to dismiss, Palacios sought leave to amend his complaint in order to drop his demand for back pay. The district court properly denied his motion. The amendment would have been futile. Aside from the Tucker Act jurisdictional problem, the Board\\u2019s denial of Palacios\\u2019s request for reconsideration is not subject to judicial review because Palacios alleges only \\u201cmaterial error\\u201d in the agency\\u2019s original decision. Sendra Corp. v. Magaw, 111 F.3d 162, 166 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (quoting ICC v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng\\u2019rs, 482 U.S. 270, 279, 107 S.Ct. 2360, 96 L.Ed.2d 222 (1987)). As we explained in Sendra, when an agency merely affirms its original decision in denying a petition for reconsideration, it has not rendered a judicially reviewable decision. Id. at 167. We have recognized two exceptions to this general rule. Neither applies here. First, a denial of reconsideration may be reviewable, albeit under an especially deferential standard of review, when the requesting party raises \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018new evidence\\u2019 or \\u2018changed circumstances.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Sendra, 111 F.3d at 166 (quoting Locomotive Eng\\u2019rs, 482 U.S. at 278, 107 S.Ct. 2360). This is so even when the governing statute or regulation allows for reconsideration on other bases, such as new argument or material error. See Locomotive Eng\\u2019rs, 482 U.S. at 277\\u201378, 107 S.Ct. 2360. Palacios concedes that his request for reconsideration raised only a new argument, so this exception does not apply. Second, courts may review an agency\\u2019s decision if the agency, despite denying reconsideration, \\u201cclearly states or indicates that it has reopened the matter.\\u201d Sendra, 111 F.3d at 167. Otherwise, we do not \\u201clook behind the agency\\u2019s formal disposition of the reconsideration request to see whether the agency \\u2018in fact\\u2019 reopened its original decision.\\u201d Id. (quoting Locomotive Eng\\u2019rs, 482 U.S. at 280, 107 S.Ct. 2360). Here the Corrections Board used boilerplate language in summarily denying Palacios\\u2019s request. This falls far short of the clear indication of reopening required to review an agency\\u2019s denial of reconsideration. The district court lacked jurisdiction over Palacios\\u2019s complaint, and it correctly determined that amendment to cure the jurisdictional defect would have been futile. We therefore dismiss the appeal with respect to the motion to transfer and affirm with respect to the motions to dismiss and for leave to amend. Dismissed in part and affirmed in part.\",\n          \"MEMORANDUM AND ORDER In 2013, defendant pleaded nolo contendere in Pennsylvania to indecent assault, a sexually violent offense, and was sentenced to a prison term of nine months to five years as a consequence of his conduct in subjecting a six-year-old child to sexual contact (see 18 Pa.C.S. \\u00a7 3126[a][7]\\u2009). \\u2002He was released on February 2, 2018, following the maximum expiration of his sentence. \\u2002Upon his relocation to Broome County, the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders prepared a risk assessment instrument that presumptively classified defendant as a risk level two sex offender (100 points) in accordance with the Sex Offender Registration Act (see Correction Law art 6\\u2013C) (see Correction Law \\u00a7\\u00a7 168\\u2013a [2][a][i]; \\u2009[d][i]\\u2009). \\u2002At the risk assessment hearing, the People adopted the Board's risk assessment recommendation and defendant challenged the assessment of points under several risk factors. \\u2002County Court assessed a risk factor score of 100, classified defendant as a risk level two sex offender and denied his request for a downward departure. \\u2002Defendant appeals. Defendant contends that he should not have been assessed 15 points under both risk factor 12, for not accepting responsibility for his conduct and refusing sex offender treatment, and risk factor 14, for release without supervision, and that assessing points under both risk factors constitutes double counting. \\u2002We disagree. \\u2002With regard to risk factor 12, the sex offender guidelines provide that \\u201c[a]n offender who does not accept responsibility for his [or her] conduct or minimizes what occurred is a poor prospect for rehabilitation,\\u201d and that refusal to participate in sex offender treatment is \\u201cpowerful evidence of the offender's continued denial and his [or her] unwillingness to alter his [or her] behavior\\u201d (Sex Offender Registration Act: \\u2009Risk Assessment Guidelines and Commentary at 15\\u201316 [2006]\\u2009). \\u2002The case summary and other reliable documentary evidence established that, when he was interviewed by police, defendant denied the charged conduct and blamed the victim and another child (see People v. DePerno, 165 A.D.3d 1351, 1352, 84 N.Y.S.3d 605 [2018], lv denied 32 N.Y.3d 915, 2019 WL 690310 [2019]). \\u2002Defendant also explicitly \\u201crefused\\u201d treatment while incarcerated (Sex Offender Registration Act: Risk Assessment Guidelines and Commentary at 16 [2006]; \\u2009cf. \\u2002People v. Ford, 25 N.Y.3d 939, 941, 6 N.Y.S.3d 541, 29 N.E.3d 888 [2015]). \\u2002Contrary to his claims, a plea of nolo contendere, like an Alford plea (see North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 [1970]), \\u201cdoes not entail an admission of culpability and, thus, may properly be treated as a refusal to accept responsibility,\\u201d along with other relevant circumstances, for purposes of risk factor 12 (People v. Matthie, 34 A.D.3d 987, 990, 824 N.Y.S.2d 454 [2006], lvs denied 8 N.Y.3d 805, 831 N.Y.S.2d 106, 863 N.E.2d 111, 8 N.Y.3d 847, 830 N.Y.S.2d 706, 862 N.E.2d 798 [2007]; \\u2009see People v. Briggs, 86 A.D.3d 903, 904, 928 N.Y.S.2d 108 [2011]; \\u2009People v. Hazen, 47 A.D.3d 1091, 1092, 850 N.Y.S.2d 267 [2008]; \\u2009see also Matter of Kasckarow v. Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders of State of N.Y., 25 N.Y.3d 1039, 1042, 10 N.Y.S.3d 492, 32 N.E.3d 927 [2015]; \\u2009Matter of Silmon v.

Briggs, 86 A.D.3d at 904, 928 N.Y.S.2d 108; \\u2009People v. Mercado, 55 A.D.3d 583, 583\\u2013584, 865 N.Y.S.2d 629 [2008], lv denied 11 N.Y.3d 714, 873 N.Y.S.2d 269, 901 N.E.2d 763 [2008]; \\u2009People v. Brister, 38 A.D.3d 634, 634, 832 N.Y.S.2d 246 [2007], lv denied 8 N.Y.3d 815, 839 N.Y.S.2d 453, 870 N.E.2d 694 [2007]; \\u2009People v. Matthie, 34 A.D.3d at 990, 824 N.Y.S.2d 454). In challenging the assessment of 15 points under risk factor 14, defendant does not dispute that he was released from a Pennsylvania prison without any supervision. \\u2002Rather, his argument is that he was held until the maximum expiration of his sentence and released without supervision solely due to his refusal to participate in a sex offender treatment program and, thus, County Court impermissibly double counted his refusal to participate in treatment under both risk factors 12 and 14. \\u2002However, the purpose of the risk level determination is \\u201cto assess the risk of a repeat offense by [a] sex offender and the threat posed to the public safety\\u201d (Correction Law \\u00a7 168\\u2013l [5]; \\u2009see People v. Mingo, 12 N.Y.3d 563, 571, 883 N.Y.S.2d 154, 910 N.E.2d 983 [2009]) and, to that end, \\u201c[t]he guidelines emphasize the importance of strict supervision to avoid repeat offenses when sex offenders are released into the community\\u201d (People v. Grimm, 107 A.D.3d 1040, 1043, 967 N.Y.S.2d 189 [2013], lv denied 21 N.Y.3d 1042, 972 N.Y.S.2d 540, 995 N.E.2d 856 [2013], citing Sex Offender Registration Act: \\u2009Risk Assessment Guidelines and Commentary at 17 [2006]; \\u2009see People v. Saravia, 154 A.D.3d 1022, 1024, 61 N.Y.S.3d 723 [2017]). \\u2002As there is no dispute that defendant was a convicted sex offender who was released without any supervision, regardless of the reasons for the lack of supervision, he was properly assessed 15 points under this risk factor (see People v. Saravia, 154 A.D.3d at 1024, 61 N.Y.S.3d 723; \\u2009People v. Middlemiss, 153 A.D.3d 1096, 1098, 60 N.Y.S.3d 593 [2017], lv denied 30 N.Y.3d 906, 2017 WL 5615862 [2017]; \\u2009People v. Leeks, 43 A.D.3d 1251, 1252, 842 N.Y.S.2d 613 [2007]). \\u2002There has been no finding that supervision would not reduce defendant's risk of reoffending, and the fact that his refusal to undergo treatment resulted in his later unsupervised release did not reduce his risk of recidivism or constitute an impermissible double counting with regard to factor 12. Although we agree with defendant that the County Court should have applied a preponderance of the evidence standard to defendant's request for a downward departure, remittal is unnecessary as the record is sufficient to enable this Court to review defendant's contentions under the proper standard (see People v. Gillotti, 23 N.Y.3d 841, 845, 861, 994 N.Y.S.2d 1, 18 N.E.3d 701 [2014]; \\u2009People v. Coe, 167 A.D.3d 1175, 1176, 88 N.Y.S.3d 717 [2018]; \\u2009People v. Simons, 157 A.D.3d 1063, 1065, 69 N.Y.S.3d 185 [2018]). \\u2002In seeking a downward departure, it was defendant's burden to demonstrate, \\u201cby a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of mitigating factors not adequately taken into consideration by the risk assessment guidelines\\u201d (People v. Wilson, 167 A.D.3d 1192, 1193, 88 N.Y.S.3d 715 [2018] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]\\u2009). \\u2002Defendant argues that a downward departure was warranted in that, had he been sentenced in New York, he would have received a period of postrelease supervision and, thus, he would not have been assessed 15 points under risk factor 14 for unsupervised release (see Penal Law \\u00a7\\u00a7 70.45 [2\\u2013a]; \\u200970.80[1], [9]\\u2009). \\u2002However, even deducting the 15 points assessed under risk factor 14, defendant would have a total risk score of 85, still a presumptive risk level two sex offender. \\u2002More to the point, the reason for his unsupervised release \\u2014 refusal to participate in sex offender treatment \\u2014 does not minimize his risk of reoffending and is certainly not a mitigating factor. \\u2002Upon our review of the record under the proper standard, we do not find that there were mitigating factors present that were not adequately taken into consideration by the guidelines and, thus, we are satisfied that County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the requested downward departure and in classifying defendant as a risk level two sex offender (see People v. Gillotti, 23 N.Y.3d at 861, 994 N.Y.S.2d 1, 18 N.E.3d 701).  ORDERED that the order is affirmed, without costs.\",\n          \" Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Ellen M. Spodek, J.), dated August 13, 2015. \\u2002The order granted the motions of the respondents for leave to renew and, upon renewal, granted their prior cross motion to vacate an arbitration award. ORDERED that the order is reversed, on the law, with one bill of costs payable by the respondents appearing separately and filing separate briefs, and the respondents' motions for leave to renew their prior cross motion to vacate the arbitration award are denied. Many of the underlying facts are set forth in our decision and order on a related appeal from an order dated November 27, 2012 (see Mew Equity, LLC v. Sutton Land Servs., LLC, 144 A.D.3d 872, 41 N.Y.S.3d 281 [Appellate Division Docket No. 2014\\u201300281; \\u2009decided herewith]\\u2009). In an order dated January 30, 2014, the Supreme Court modified portions of an arbitration award dated August 9, 2012, issued by a rabbinical court (hereinafter the 2012 award), confirmed the 2012 award as so modified, and denied the respondents' cross motion to vacate the 2012 award in its entirety. \\u2002Thereafter, the respondent Mendel Brach moved, and the remaining respondents separately moved, for leave to renew their cross motion to vacate the 2012 award. \\u2002In an order dated August 13, 2015, the court granted leave to renew, and upon renewal, in effect, vacated the prior determination denying the respondents' cross motion to vacate the 2012 award and, thereupon, granted the cross motion and remitted the matter to the rabbinical court for a rehearing and a new determination. \\u2003\\u201c\\u2009\\u2018A motion for leave to renew shall be based upon new facts not offered on the prior motion that would change the prior determination and shall contain reasonable justification for the failure to present such facts on the prior motion\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d (Cioffi v.

NYCPD, 85 A.D.3d 1001, 1003, 926 N.Y.S.2d 121). \\u2003Here, in support of their renewal motions, the respondents submitted answers to interrogatories obtained in a separate civil action. \\u2002Those answers were given by an attorney who had represented the petitioners in connection with the underlying transactions, and were not available to the respondents at the time they made their cross motion to vacate the 2012 award. \\u2002Contrary to the Supreme Court's determination, the facts adduced from those interrogatory answers were merely cumulative with respect to the factual material submitted in connection with the respondents' cross motion, and did not demonstrate that the petitioners fraudulently concealed material information from the rabbinical court (see Varela v. Clark, 134 A.D.3d 925, 926, 21 N.Y.S.3d 331; \\u2009Yerushalmi v.

On appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in its classification, valuation, and distribution of the parties\\u2019 property and in granting defendant Gertha\\u2009 Watson (\\u201cWife\\u201d) an unequal distribution of martial property. Because the trial court\\u2019s findings of fact do not support its conclusions of law and because the distributional factors found by the trial court are based upon some of those erroneous findings and conclusions, we reverse the equitable distribution order and remand for entry of a new equitable distribution order. Background Husband and Wife were married in November 1989. Although the trial court\\u2019s equitable distribution order found the date of separation as October 2007, the parties stipulated in the final pretrial order to a date of separation of October 2009. Husband filed a claim for divorce and equitable distribution on 2 April 2015. On 1 June 2015, Wife filed her answer and counterclaims for post separation support, alimony, unequal distribution of marital property, and attorney\\u2019s fees. A hearing was held on 25 October 2016. Following the hearing, the trial court entered an equitable distribution order on 28 February 2017, which granted an unequal distribution in Wife\\u2019s favor. Husband timely appealed to this Court. Analysis Husband argues that the trial court erred in valuing and distributing a portion of the parties\\u2019 marital property and in granting Wife an unequal distribution of the marital property. The parties had only a few assets and one debt in contention. They had a home acquired a year before the marriage as joint tenants; the trial court found the marital home is \\u201cseparate property held by a joint tenancy between the parties\\u201d but distributed the house to Wife and ordered Husband to execute any documents necessary to remove his name from the title and to pay the Home Equity Line of Credit (\\u201cHELOC\\u201d), which was secured by the marital home during the marriage, in a timely manner. The trial court also found that \\u201c[t]here is considerable equity in the marital residence which is marital property.\\u201d The trial court found the HELOC debt is Husband\\u2019s separate debt but found that it was \\u201cwithout any sufficient/or and competent evidence\\u201d of the remaining balance as of the date of separation to determine the payoff, although it made findings of the balance owed as of May 2015 of $42,689.58. Husband also had a 401K plan with his employer which the trial court classified as marital property but again, the trial court found \\u201c[t]here is no sufficient and competent evidence to value [Husband\\u2019s] 401K\\u201d as of the date of separation. The other item in contention is a Cadillac El Dorado, which is marital property. Husband challenges some findings of fact as unsupported by the evidence and some conclusions of law as unsupported by the facts. He also argues that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering an unequal distribution based upon its erroneous findings of fact. Our review of an equitable distribution order is limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in distributing the parties\\u2019 marital property. Accordingly, the findings of fact are conclusive if they are supported by any competent evidence from the record. However, even applying this generous standard of review, there are still requirements with which trial courts must comply. Under N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250\\u201320(c), equitable distribution is a three-step process; the trial court must (1) determine what is marital and divisible property; (2) find the net value of the property; and (3) make an equitable distribution of that property. \\u2024 In fact, to enter a proper equitable distribution judgment, the trial court must specifically and particularly classify and value all assets and debts maintained by the parties at the date of separation. In determining the value of the property, the trial court must consider the property\\u2019s market value, if any, less the amount of any encumbrance serving to offset or reduce the market value. Furthermore, in doing all these things the court must be specific and detailed enough to enable a reviewing court to determine what was done and its correctness. Robinson v. Robinson, 210 N.C. App. 319, 322-23, 707 S.E.2d 785, 789 (2011) (citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted). As to the actual distribution ordered by the trial court, when reviewing an equitable distribution order the standard of review is limited to a determination of whether there was a clear abuse of discretion. A trial court may be reversed for abuse of discretion only upon a showing that its actions are manifestly unsupported by reason. Stovall v. Stovall, 205 N.C. App. 405, 407-08, 698 S.E.2d 680, 683 (2010) (citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted). I.\\u2003Classification issues Although Husband does not clearly identify an issue of classification of property, his arguments are largely based upon the trial court\\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding classification. Neither the order nor Husband\\u2019s brief separates the issues of classification, valuation, and distribution, but to review the issues, we must separate them. \\u201c[E]quitable distribution is a three-step process; the trial court must (1) determine what is marital and divisible property; (2) find the net value of the property; and (3) make an equitable distribution of that property.\\u201d Robinson, 210 N.C. App. at 323, 707 S.E.2d at 789 (citation, quotation marks, and brackets omitted). Husband argues the trial court erred by distributing the home to Wife and ordering him to remove his name from the deed and pay the HELOC, and his argument is primarily based upon the unequal distribution factors found by the trial court. But first, we must consider the classification of the home. The order is internally contradictory on the classification of the home. The trial court found that the home is \\u201cseparate property held by a joint tenancy between the parties.\\u201d Separate property cannot be distributed in equitable distribution. See Langston v. Richardson, 206 N.C. App. 216, 220, 696 S.E.2d 867, 871 (2010) (\\u201cUnder N.C. Gen. Stat. Sec. 50\\u201320(c), only marital property is subject to distribution. The trial court must classify and identify property as marital or separate depending upon the proof presented to the trial court of the nature of the assets.\\u201d (Citations and quotation marks omitted)\\u2009). But then the trial court also found that \\u201cthere is considerable equity in the marital residence which is marital property.\\u201d But if there is marital equity in the home, the trial court must value the marital interest before distributing it. See Turner v. Turner, 64 N.C. App. 342, 345, 307 S.E.2d 407, 408-09 (1983) (\\u201cUnder G.S. 50-20(c), equitable distribution applies only to the net value of marital property. This requires the trial court to first ascertain what is marital property, then to find the net value of that property, and finally to make a distribution based upon the equitable goals of the statute and the various factors specified therein.\\u201d). And if the home itself is separate property, as the trial court found, it is not subject to distribution, yet the trial court distributed it to Wife, making essentially the same error as the court in Turner: If the house was purchased by plaintiff before the marriage, as the finding states, then it was error to subject the house, as such, to equitable distribution, since under G.S. 50-20(a)(2), property acquired by a spouse before marriage is \\u201cseparate,\\u201d rather than \\u201cmarital,\\u201d property. If, however, an equity in this property developed during the marriage because of improvements or payments contributed to by defendant, that equity (as distinguished from a mere increase in value of separate property, excluded by the statute) could be marital property, in our opinion, upon appropriate, supportable findings being made. And if not marital property, such equity, if it developed, would be a factor requiring consideration by the court, along with the other factors specified in the statute, before determining how much of the marital property each party is entitled to receive. \\u2024 But the findings made do not support the division ordered. Turner, 64 N.C. App. at 346, 307 S.E.2d at 409. The trial court therefore erred by distributing the home, and on remand, the trial court should follow the process set forth in Turner to classify and value the home and any marital or separate interests in the home and to distribute any marital interest. A.\\u2003Cadillac El Dorado Husband contends that the trial court\\u2019s finding of fact valuing the 1995 Cadillac El Dorado at $10,000.00 is not supported by the evidence. We agree there is no evidence to support a finding of the value of the car as $10,000.00 as of the date of separation. The final pretrial order included schedules \\u201csetting out the parties\\u2019 contentions as to the nature and values of the marital property.\\u201d Wife valued the 1995 Cadillac at $1,880.00; Husband also valued the Cadillac at $1,880.00. Husband argues the parties \\u201cstiplulated\\u201d to the value so the court was bound by the stipulation. Wife counters that the parties did not sign the pretrial order and did not stipulate to values, although they both listed the same value. We agree that the pretrial order does not include a formal \\u201cstipulation\\u201d of value, but both parties alleged the same value. And the Pretrial Order did not purport to be a consent order which should be signed by the parties; it was entered based upon the pretrial conference held on 24 November 2015, and Wife claims no impropriety in the trial court\\u2019s entry of the pretrial order. The only evidence of the sum of $10,000.00 was Husband\\u2019s testimony he had paid off a $10,000.00 balance of the loan on the vehicle with a portion of the proceeds from the HELOC, which he received in 2005, four years prior to the date of separation. But a loan payoff on a vehicle years prior to separation is not evidence of the fair market value of the vehicle on the date of separation. See generally Walter v. Walter, 149 N.C. App. 723, 733, 561 S.E.2d 571, 577 (2002) (\\u201cIn an equitable distribution proceeding, the trial court is to determine the net fair market value of the property based on the evidence offered by the parties.\\u201d). On remand, the court should value the car based upon the evidence of fair market value as of the date of separation, and it appears that $1,880.00 is the only evidence of value as of the date of separation. See generally Warren v. Warren, 175 N.C. App. 509, 515, 623 S.E.2d 800, 804 (2006) (\\u201cIn equitable distribution proceedings, marital property must be valued as of the date of the separation of the parties.\\u201d (Citation and quotation marks omitted)\\u2009). B.\\u2003Valuation of home equity, HELOC, and 401K plan Husband addresses this issue as part of his argument regarding unequal distribution factors, but as noted above, the issue originates in the classification and valuation, or lack thereof, of these items and the order\\u2019s distribution of these assets. Equitable distribution is a three-step process: classification, valuation, and distribution. See generally Robinson, 210 N.C. App. at 323, 707 S.E.2d at 789. These three steps must be taken in order, so if the evidence is not sufficient to classify or value an item of property or debt, it cannot distributed. See, e.g., Estate of Nelson ex rel. Brewer v. Nelson, 179 N.C. App. 166, 168-69, 633 S.E.2d 124, 127 (2006) (\\u201cFailure to follow these steps carefully and in sequence may render the findings and conclusions inadequate, erroneous, or both.\\u201d), aff\\u2019d per curiam, 361 N.C. 346, 643 S.E.2d 587 (2007). Husband took out a HELOC secured by the marital home during the marriage, but the trial court found that the HELOC is Husband\\u2019s separate debt based upon its findings regarding Husband\\u2019s sole control over the HELOC and his use of the funds. The trial court was unable to value the outstanding debt as of the date of separation because there was not sufficient evidence of this value. But since the HELOC was classified as a separate debt, it need not be valued and cannot be distributed. See, e.g., Smith v. Smith, 111 N.C. App. 460, 509-10, 433 S.E.2d 196, 226 (1993) (citations omitted) (\\u201cIn determining an equitable distribution, the trial court must consider the debts of the parties. If the debt is a separate debt of one of the parties, then the court must consider it pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)(1). If the debt is a marital debt, that is, a debt incurred during the marriage for the joint benefit of the parties, then it must be valued and distributed.\\u201d (Citations and quotation marks omitted)\\u2009), rev\\u2019d in part on other grounds, 336 N.C. 575, 444 S.E.2d 420 (1994). Classification of property and debt comes first, and only marital property or debt is subject to the next two steps of valuation and distribution. See, e.g., Wall v. Wall, 140 N.C. App. 303, 307-08, 536 S.E.2d 647, 650 (2000) (\\u201cWe continue to stress the importance of following the steps of first classifying, then valuing and distributing marital property. Each step is a prerequisite to the performance of the next, and failure to follow the prescribed order will result in a fatally flawed trial court disposition. Only those assets and debts that are classified as marital property and valued are subject to distribution under the Equitable Distribution Act[.]\\u201d (Citation and quotation marks omitted)\\u2009). In this case, the trial court found there was not \\u201csufficient and competent evidence to value [Husband\\u2019s] 401K\\u201d as of the date of separation. Husband agrees with this finding, since it would be to his benefit, except that the trial court also used the 401K as a factor justifying the unequal distribution. Wife agrees the trial court did not have sufficient evidence to value the 401K, but she argues that it need not be valued to be a distributional factor. She is correct that the trial court need not value items used as distributional factors. See Gum v. Gum, 107 N.C. App. 734, 739, 421 S.E.2d 788, 791 (1992) (\\u201cThe trial court is required to consider evidence of such contributions as a distributional factor according to N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250\\u201320(c)(8). There is no language within \\u00a7 [50-20(c)\\u2009] which would indicate that the trial court is required to place a monetary value on any distributional factor and we decline to impose such an unnecessary burden upon the trial court.\\u201d). But marital property must be valued, see, e.g., Robinson, 210 N.C. App. at 324, 707 S.E.2d at 790 (\\u201cIt is not enough that evidence can be found within the record which could support such classification; the court must actually classify all of the property and make a finding as to the value of all marital property.\\u201d), and the trial court found that 401K plan was marital property but did not value it. If the 401K is not marital property, the trial court could have used it as a distributional factor without valuing it; but if it is marital property, it must first be valued as part of the marital estate. See generally Gum, 107 N.C. App. at 739, 421 S.E.2d at 791; Robinson, 210 N.C. App. at 324, 707 S.E.2d at 790. There is no way to know if the distribution of the marital estate is equal or unequal if there is no finding on the net value of the entire marital estate. The trial court determines the credibility and weight of the evidence, see, e.g., Brackney v. Brackney, 199 N.C. App. 375, 390, 682 S.E.2d 401, 410 (2009) (\\u201c[I]t is well-established \\u2024 that when the trial court is the trier of fact, the court is empowered to assign weight to the evidence presented at the trial as it deems appropriate.\\u201d (Citation, quotation marks, and brackets omitted)\\u2009), and it is possible the trial court did not believe Husband\\u2019s evidence regarding the value of the 401K. But we are concerned that the trial court\\u2019s finding might be based upon the erroneous date of separation in the order. There was evidence, in the form of a letter from the 401K plan administrator, MassMutual Retirement Services Division, of the vested balance of the 401K as of 31 October 2009, the month of the parties\\u2019 separation. Yet the trial court found the parties separated in October 2007. The trial court would be correct there was no evidence of the value of the 401K in 2007\\u2014but that is not the relevant year because the parties did not separate until 2009. Wife contends the finding of the year 2007 is merely a non-prejudicial clerical error. But considering the trial court\\u2019s finding of a lack of evidence of the value of the 401K as of the date of separation, along with the evidence of a letter from the 401K plan administrator valuing the plan as of the date of separation, we cannot say for sure the date error is nonprejudicial. Again, it is possible the trial court did not rely upon the 401K plan administrator\\u2019s letter for some other reason, and that would be within the trial court\\u2019s discretion, but since we are vacating this order for other reasons, on remand, the trial court should clarify its findings regarding the valuation of the 401K as of the date of separation or its inability to value the plan. III.\\u2003Unequal Distribution of the Marital Property Husband contends that the trial court abused its discretion in granting Wife an unequal distribution because the primary findings of factors supporting the unequal distribution are legally and factually incorrect. Based upon the errors in classification and valuation discussed above, including the absence of a finding of the total value of the net marital estate, we must vacate the order and remand for entry of a new order, but we will address Husband\\u2019s argument to avoid potential errors regarding the distributional factors on remand. North Carolina General Statutes Section 50-20(c) sets out the factors the trial court should consider when determining whether an equal division is equitable. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c) (2017). \\u201cWhere the trial court decides that an unequal distribution is equitable, the court must exercise its discretion to decide how much weight to give each factor supporting an unequal distribution. A single distributional factor may support an unequal division.\\u201d Mugno v. Mugno, 205 N.C. App. 273, 278, 695 S.E.2d 495, 499 (2010) (citations omitted). Here, the trial court determined that an unequal distribution of the marital and divisible property was equitable, and the court found these factors as justification for an unequal division: 35. N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)\\u2014Distributional Factors: That in considering whether an equal distribution would be equitable, the Court has considered all of the evidence presented by the parties relating to the statutory factors set out in Chapter 50-20(c) of the North Carolina General Statutes (as more particularly set out in the findings of fact contained in this judgment), and specifically including the following: a. N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)(1): At the time that the property division is to become effective, [Husband] is employed and will have received the majority of his 401K from Electro Switch, as well as having received the majority of, if not all of the benefit for the funds borrowed against the marital residence via the HELOC. [Wife] is receiving the marital residence. b. N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)(2): There is no obligation for support arising out of a prior marriage. c. N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)(3): The parties were married eighteen (18) years. Both parties are in good mental health. Both parties are limited in what they may do for employment although [Husband] continues to work. \\u2024 e. N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)(5): [Husband] has obtained loans on his 401K, has received a substantial portion of it to date to the exclusion of [Wife], and will receive all that remains of it. f. N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)(6): Both parties contributed to the purchase of the Marital residence and its eventual pay off. \\u2024 i. N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)(9): The 401K and the equity that remains in the residence are the largest Liquid assets the parties have. There is no sufficient and competent evidence to value [Husband\\u2019s] 401K, the exact amount of principle (sic) remaining on the HELOC and as a result the exact amount of equity in the Marital Residence. \\u2024 36. An equal distribution of marital and divisible property is not equitable in this matter. The court found that \\u201c[n]o evidence was presented\\u201d regarding any of the other factors in N.C. Gen. Stat. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c). The primary factor the trial court used to justify an unequal distribution was (i), but the trial court\\u2019s finding \\u201c[t]he 401K and the equity that remains in the residence are the largest Liquid assets the parties have\\u201d presents several problems. First, neither of these marital assets was valued, as discussed above. The second problem is either a serious clerical error or a misunderstanding of the meaning of the term \\u201cliquid.\\u201d Black\\u2019s Law Dictionary defines a liquid asset as \\u201c[a]n asset that is readily convertible to cash, such as a marketable security, a note, or an account receivable.\\u201d Black\\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). In comparison, an illiquid asset is defined as \\u201c[a]n asset that is not readily convertible into cash, usu. because of (1) the lack of demand, (2) the absence of an established market, or (3) the substantial cost or time required for liquidation (such as real property, even when it is desirable).\\u201d Illiquid asset, Black\\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th Ed. 2014) (emphasis added). A 401K plan is not liquid since it is not readily accessible and any withdrawals prior to retirement incur substantial taxes and penalties. Equity in a home is not liquid because the home must be sold to get access to the equity. See e.g., Robertson v. Robertson, 167 N.C. App. 567, 571, 605 S.E.2d 667, 669-70 (2004) (\\u201cAlthough the trial court found defendant could liquidate the above assets to pay the $52,100.07 distributive award, the only liquid assets readily available to pay the award were two bank accounts totaling $5,929.38. Wife\\u2019s other assets included stock in PSI valued at $37,336.00, the unencumbered one-half acre lot valued at $8,920.00, and the personal property valued at $13,829.68. With the exception of the pension plan, which the trial court found would be difficult to liquidate and might cause unfavorable tax consequences, the trial court failed to make findings concerning the difficulty and possible financial and tax consequences of borrowing money against or liquidating the PSI stock, the one-half acre lot, and the personal property in order to pay the amount of the judgment lien within ninety days. Accordingly, although Wife may in fact be able to pay the distributive award, her evidence is sufficient to raise the question of whether adjusting the award from her to Husband is necessary to offset any adverse financial consequences of using the non-liquid assets.\\u201d (Citations, quotation marks, brackets, and ellipses omitted)\\u2009). As discussed above on valuation, the remainder of the finding on factor (i) is also erroneous because the marital property was not valued. The trial court found it could not value the marital equity in the home or the 401K plan. It found there was \\u201cno sufficient and competent evidence to value [Husband]\\u2019s 401K\\u201d and that the exact amount of principal remaining on the HELOC and the equity in the marital residence were also unknown. Without valuation of the marital assets, it is impossible to say if a distribution is equal or unequal. See generally Crowder v. Crowder, 147 N.C. App. 677, 681, 556 S.E.2d 639, 642 (2001) (\\u201cThe distribution of marital assets entails the court\\u2019s determination of an \\u2018equitable\\u2019 division of marital property. The marital property is to be distributed equally, unless the court determines equal is not equitable.\\u201d (Citation and quotation marks omitted)\\u2009). Yet the court nevertheless used these unvalued marital assets in its determination that an unequal distribution was equitable, as evidenced in findings (a), (e), (f), and (i). Once those findings discussed above are removed, we are left only with its findings: (b) that \\u201c[t]here is no obligation for support arising out of a prior marriage\\u201d and (c) that \\u201c[t]he parties were married eighteen (18) years. Both parties are in good mental health. Both parties are limited in what they may do for employment although [Husband] continues to work.\\u201d These factors are essentially descriptions of the parties\\u2019 circumstances and while they are relevant, they cannot, standing alone, support the trial court\\u2019s conclusion that an unequal distribution is equitable. Since the court based an \\u201cunequal\\u201d distribution on marital assets that were not valued and on a misunderstanding of \\u201cliquid\\u201d assets, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering an unequal distribution. IV.\\u2003Conclusion The trial court\\u2019s order on equitable distribution is reversed and we remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, within 30 days after mandate issues on this opinion, either party may file a written request with the trial court for a hearing to present additional evidence or argument, and if a party files a timely request, the trial court shall hold a hearing to \\u201cto hear arguments and receive evidence from both parties on remand, in order to address the errors discussed above and to properly identify, classify, and value the parties\\u2019 property as required by statutory law and case law.\\u201d Dalgewicz v. Dalgewicz, 167 N.C. App. 412, 424, 606 S.E.2d 164, 172 (2004). If neither party files a timely written request for hearing on remand, the trial court may, in its sole discretion, determine whether to hold an additional hearing or to enter a new order based upon the evidence presented at the prior hearing.

The district court, after determining that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, dismissed Palacios\\u2019s complaint, denied his motion for leave to amend the complaint, and rejected his motion to transfer the case to the United States Court of Federal Claims. Palacios v. Spencer, 267 F.Supp.3d 1 (D.D.C. 2017). Palacios appeals each of the district court\\u2019s rulings. Palacios served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1992 to 1995. He received an other-than-honorable discharge stemming from his pattern of misconduct. In about 2002 and 2009, he sought an upgrade of his discharge on the basis that his misconduct resulted from his mental and physical disabilities. The Naval Discharge Review Board denied both of his requests. Palacios then asked the Board for Correction of Naval Records to correct his records. The Correction Board denied his request in 2010. In response, Palacios filed an action for judicial review of the Correction Board\\u2019s decision in the Court of Federal Claims. The Claims Court dismissed his suit as untimely under the statute of limitations applicable to his wrongful-discharge claim. Palacios v. United States, 100 Fed.Cl. 656 (2011). The Federal Circuit affirmed. Palacios v. United States, No. 2012-5028, 2012 WL 2415348 (Fed. Cir. Mar. 8, 2012) (per curiam) (unpublished order). This appeal arises from Palacios\\u2019s request that the Correction Board reconsider its decision. After the Board denied this request in 2015, Palacios filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. He claimed that the Board\\u2019s denial of reconsideration was arbitrary and capricious, unsupported by substantial evidence, and contrary to law under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \\u00a7 706(2). His prayer for relief asked the district court to enter judgment correcting his disability rating and discharge, awarding costs and attorneys\\u2019 fees, and \\u201c[g]ranting Plaintiff appropriate back pay and benefits that would natural[ly] flow from the upgrade in discharge status.\\u201d In the alternative, he asked the district court to remand to the Correction Board for consideration on the merits. The government moved to dismiss on the ground that Palacios\\u2019s complaint fell outside the applicable statute of limitations and that it asserted a claim under the Tucker Act over which the Court of Federal Claims had exclusive jurisdiction. In his opposition to the government\\u2019s motion to dismiss, Palacios moved for leave to amend his complaint by dropping his request for money damages or, in the alternative, to transfer the case to the Court of Federal Claims. When a party in the district court moves to transfer the case to the Court of Federal Claims, see 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1631, a statutory procedure is triggered: \\u201cno further proceedings shall be taken in the district court until 60 days after the court has ruled upon the motion,\\u201d 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1292(d)(4)(B). If the district court grants or denies the motion, the Federal Circuit has \\u201cexclusive jurisdiction of an appeal\\u201d from that order. 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1292(d)(4)(A). If there is an appeal, the district court\\u2019s \\u201cproceedings shall be further stayed until the appeal has been decided.\\u201d Id. \\u00a7 1292(d)(4)(B). The district court in this case did not follow this statutory procedure, perhaps because neither Palacios nor the government brought the governing statutes to the court\\u2019s attention. The district court, rather than staying its proceedings, denied Palacios\\u2019s transfer motion, granted the government\\u2019s motion to dismiss, and denied Palacios\\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint. Because the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from orders granting or denying the transfer of an action to the Court of Federal Claims, we dismiss for want of jurisdiction Palacios\\u2019s appeal from that aspect of the district court\\u2019s judgment. See Murthy v. Vilsack, 609 F.3d 460, 461\\u201364 (D.C. Cir. 2010). As to the district court\\u2019s dismissal of the complaint, we agree that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over Palacios\\u2019s complaint. The complaint expressly demanded the entry of a judgment including an award of back pay exceeding $10,000. Under the Tucker Act, the Court of Federal Claims therefore had exclusive jurisdiction over this claim. See 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 1346(a)(2), 1491(a); Schwalier v. Hagel, 734 F.3d 1218, 1220\\u201322 (D.C. Cir. 2013); Sawyer v. United States, 930 F.2d 1577, 1580\\u201381 (Fed. Cir. 1991); Van Drasek v. Lehman, 762 F.2d 1065, 1067\\u201372 (D.C. Cir. 1985). Palacios argues that primarily his complaint sought to correct his military records and that the essence of his complaint was therefore not monetary. We \\u201clook only to the essence of a complaint in the absence of an explicit request for monetary relief.\\u201d Schwalier, 734 F.3d at 1221. Our decisions examining a complaint\\u2019s essence therefore do not apply. See, e.g., Tootle v. Sec\\u2019y of the Navy, 446 F.3d 167, 169, 173\\u201377 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Kidwell v. Dep\\u2019t of the Army, Bd. for Correction of Military Records, 56 F.3d 279, 284\\u201386 (D.C. Cir. 1995). It follows that the district court correctly dismissed the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., Fisher-Cal Indus., Inc. v. United States, 747 F.3d 899, 902\\u201303 (D.C. Cir. 2014). In opposing the government\\u2019s motion to dismiss, Palacios sought leave to amend his complaint in order to drop his demand for back pay. The district court properly denied his motion. The amendment would have been futile. Aside from the Tucker Act jurisdictional problem, the Board\\u2019s denial of Palacios\\u2019s request for reconsideration is not subject to judicial review because Palacios alleges only \\u201cmaterial error\\u201d in the agency\\u2019s original decision. Sendra Corp. v. Magaw, 111 F.3d 162, 166 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (quoting ICC v. Bhd. of Locomotive Eng\\u2019rs, 482 U.S. 270, 279, 107 S.Ct. 2360, 96 L.Ed.2d 222 (1987)). As we explained in Sendra, when an agency merely affirms its original decision in denying a petition for reconsideration, it has not rendered a judicially reviewable decision. Id. at 167. We have recognized two exceptions to this general rule. Neither applies here. First, a denial of reconsideration may be reviewable, albeit under an especially deferential standard of review, when the requesting party raises \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018new evidence\\u2019 or \\u2018changed circumstances.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Sendra, 111 F.3d at 166 (quoting Locomotive Eng\\u2019rs, 482 U.S. at 278, 107 S.Ct. 2360). This is so even when the governing statute or regulation allows for reconsideration on other bases, such as new argument or material error. See Locomotive Eng\\u2019rs, 482 U.S. at 277\\u201378, 107 S.Ct. 2360. Palacios concedes that his request for reconsideration raised only a new argument, so this exception does not apply. Second, courts may review an agency\\u2019s decision if the agency, despite denying reconsideration, \\u201cclearly states or indicates that it has reopened the matter.\\u201d Sendra, 111 F.3d at 167. Otherwise, we do not \\u201clook behind the agency\\u2019s formal disposition of the reconsideration request to see whether the agency \\u2018in fact\\u2019 reopened its original decision.\\u201d Id. (quoting Locomotive Eng\\u2019rs, 482 U.S. at 280, 107 S.Ct. 2360). Here the Corrections Board used boilerplate language in summarily denying Palacios\\u2019s request. This falls far short of the clear indication of reopening required to review an agency\\u2019s denial of reconsideration. The district court lacked jurisdiction over Palacios\\u2019s complaint, and it correctly determined that amendment to cure the jurisdictional defect would have been futile. We therefore dismiss the appeal with respect to the motion to transfer and affirm with respect to the motions to dismiss and for leave to amend. Dismissed in part and affirmed in part.\",\n          \"MEMORANDUM AND ORDER In 2013, defendant pleaded nolo contendere in Pennsylvania to indecent assault, a sexually violent offense, and was sentenced to a prison term of nine months to five years as a consequence of his conduct in subjecting a six-year-old child to sexual contact (see 18 Pa.C.S. \\u00a7 3126[a][7]\\u2009). \\u2002He was released on February 2, 2018, following the maximum expiration of his sentence. \\u2002Upon his relocation to Broome County, the Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders prepared a risk assessment instrument that presumptively classified defendant as a risk level two sex offender (100 points) in accordance with the Sex Offender Registration Act (see Correction Law art 6\\u2013C) (see Correction Law \\u00a7\\u00a7 168\\u2013a [2][a][i]; \\u2009[d][i]\\u2009). \\u2002At the risk assessment hearing, the People adopted the Board's risk assessment recommendation and defendant challenged the assessment of points under several risk factors. \\u2002County Court assessed a risk factor score of 100, classified defendant as a risk level two sex offender and denied his request for a downward departure. \\u2002Defendant appeals. Defendant contends that he should not have been assessed 15 points under both risk factor 12, for not accepting responsibility for his conduct and refusing sex offender treatment, and risk factor 14, for release without supervision, and that assessing points under both risk factors constitutes double counting. \\u2002We disagree. \\u2002With regard to risk factor 12, the sex offender guidelines provide that \\u201c[a]n offender who does not accept responsibility for his [or her] conduct or minimizes what occurred is a poor prospect for rehabilitation,\\u201d and that refusal to participate in sex offender treatment is \\u201cpowerful evidence of the offender's continued denial and his [or her] unwillingness to alter his [or her] behavior\\u201d (Sex Offender Registration Act: \\u2009Risk Assessment Guidelines and Commentary at 15\\u201316 [2006]\\u2009). \\u2002The case summary and other reliable documentary evidence established that, when he was interviewed by police, defendant denied the charged conduct and blamed the victim and another child (see People v. DePerno, 165 A.D.3d 1351, 1352, 84 N.Y.S.3d 605 [2018], lv denied 32 N.Y.3d 915, 2019 WL 690310 [2019]). \\u2002Defendant also explicitly \\u201crefused\\u201d treatment while incarcerated (Sex Offender Registration Act: Risk Assessment Guidelines and Commentary at 16 [2006]; \\u2009cf. \\u2002People v. Ford, 25 N.Y.3d 939, 941, 6 N.Y.S.3d 541, 29 N.E.3d 888 [2015]). \\u2002Contrary to his claims, a plea of nolo contendere, like an Alford plea (see North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 [1970]), \\u201cdoes not entail an admission of culpability and, thus, may properly be treated as a refusal to accept responsibility,\\u201d along with other relevant circumstances, for purposes of risk factor 12 (People v. Matthie, 34 A.D.3d 987, 990, 824 N.Y.S.2d 454 [2006], lvs denied 8 N.Y.3d 805, 831 N.Y.S.2d 106, 863 N.E.2d 111, 8 N.Y.3d 847, 830 N.Y.S.2d 706, 862 N.E.2d 798 [2007]; \\u2009see People v. Briggs, 86 A.D.3d 903, 904, 928 N.Y.S.2d 108 [2011]; \\u2009People v. Hazen, 47 A.D.3d 1091, 1092, 850 N.Y.S.2d 267 [2008]; \\u2009see also Matter of Kasckarow v. Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders of State of N.Y., 25 N.Y.3d 1039, 1042, 10 N.Y.S.3d 492, 32 N.E.3d 927 [2015]; \\u2009Matter of Silmon v.

Briggs, 86 A.D.3d at 904, 928 N.Y.S.2d 108; \\u2009People v. Mercado, 55 A.D.3d 583, 583\\u2013584, 865 N.Y.S.2d 629 [2008], lv denied 11 N.Y.3d 714, 873 N.Y.S.2d 269, 901 N.E.2d 763 [2008]; \\u2009People v. Brister, 38 A.D.3d 634, 634, 832 N.Y.S.2d 246 [2007], lv denied 8 N.Y.3d 815, 839 N.Y.S.2d 453, 870 N.E.2d 694 [2007]; \\u2009People v. Matthie, 34 A.D.3d at 990, 824 N.Y.S.2d 454). In challenging the assessment of 15 points under risk factor 14, defendant does not dispute that he was released from a Pennsylvania prison without any supervision. \\u2002Rather, his argument is that he was held until the maximum expiration of his sentence and released without supervision solely due to his refusal to participate in a sex offender treatment program and, thus, County Court impermissibly double counted his refusal to participate in treatment under both risk factors 12 and 14. \\u2002However, the purpose of the risk level determination is \\u201cto assess the risk of a repeat offense by [a] sex offender and the threat posed to the public safety\\u201d (Correction Law \\u00a7 168\\u2013l [5]; \\u2009see People v. Mingo, 12 N.Y.3d 563, 571, 883 N.Y.S.2d 154, 910 N.E.2d 983 [2009]) and, to that end, \\u201c[t]he guidelines emphasize the importance of strict supervision to avoid repeat offenses when sex offenders are released into the community\\u201d (People v. Grimm, 107 A.D.3d 1040, 1043, 967 N.Y.S.2d 189 [2013], lv denied 21 N.Y.3d 1042, 972 N.Y.S.2d 540, 995 N.E.2d 856 [2013], citing Sex Offender Registration Act: \\u2009Risk Assessment Guidelines and Commentary at 17 [2006]; \\u2009see People v. Saravia, 154 A.D.3d 1022, 1024, 61 N.Y.S.3d 723 [2017]). \\u2002As there is no dispute that defendant was a convicted sex offender who was released without any supervision, regardless of the reasons for the lack of supervision, he was properly assessed 15 points under this risk factor (see People v. Saravia, 154 A.D.3d at 1024, 61 N.Y.S.3d 723; \\u2009People v. Middlemiss, 153 A.D.3d 1096, 1098, 60 N.Y.S.3d 593 [2017], lv denied 30 N.Y.3d 906, 2017 WL 5615862 [2017]; \\u2009People v. Leeks, 43 A.D.3d 1251, 1252, 842 N.Y.S.2d 613 [2007]). \\u2002There has been no finding that supervision would not reduce defendant's risk of reoffending, and the fact that his refusal to undergo treatment resulted in his later unsupervised release did not reduce his risk of recidivism or constitute an impermissible double counting with regard to factor 12. Although we agree with defendant that the County Court should have applied a preponderance of the evidence standard to defendant's request for a downward departure, remittal is unnecessary as the record is sufficient to enable this Court to review defendant's contentions under the proper standard (see People v. Gillotti, 23 N.Y.3d 841, 845, 861, 994 N.Y.S.2d 1, 18 N.E.3d 701 [2014]; \\u2009People v. Coe, 167 A.D.3d 1175, 1176, 88 N.Y.S.3d 717 [2018]; \\u2009People v. Simons, 157 A.D.3d 1063, 1065, 69 N.Y.S.3d 185 [2018]). \\u2002In seeking a downward departure, it was defendant's burden to demonstrate, \\u201cby a preponderance of the evidence, the existence of mitigating factors not adequately taken into consideration by the risk assessment guidelines\\u201d (People v. Wilson, 167 A.D.3d 1192, 1193, 88 N.Y.S.3d 715 [2018] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]\\u2009). \\u2002Defendant argues that a downward departure was warranted in that, had he been sentenced in New York, he would have received a period of postrelease supervision and, thus, he would not have been assessed 15 points under risk factor 14 for unsupervised release (see Penal Law \\u00a7\\u00a7 70.45 [2\\u2013a]; \\u200970.80[1], [9]\\u2009). \\u2002However, even deducting the 15 points assessed under risk factor 14, defendant would have a total risk score of 85, still a presumptive risk level two sex offender. \\u2002More to the point, the reason for his unsupervised release \\u2014 refusal to participate in sex offender treatment \\u2014 does not minimize his risk of reoffending and is certainly not a mitigating factor. \\u2002Upon our review of the record under the proper standard, we do not find that there were mitigating factors present that were not adequately taken into consideration by the guidelines and, thus, we are satisfied that County Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the requested downward departure and in classifying defendant as a risk level two sex offender (see People v. Gillotti, 23 N.Y.3d at 861, 994 N.Y.S.2d 1, 18 N.E.3d 701).  ORDERED that the order is affirmed, without costs.\",\n          \" Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Ellen M. Spodek, J.), dated August 13, 2015. \\u2002The order granted the motions of the respondents for leave to renew and, upon renewal, granted their prior cross motion to vacate an arbitration award. ORDERED that the order is reversed, on the law, with one bill of costs payable by the respondents appearing separately and filing separate briefs, and the respondents' motions for leave to renew their prior cross motion to vacate the arbitration award are denied. Many of the underlying facts are set forth in our decision and order on a related appeal from an order dated November 27, 2012 (see Mew Equity, LLC v.

In an order dated January 30, 2014, the Supreme Court modified portions of an arbitration award dated August 9, 2012, issued by a rabbinical court (hereinafter the 2012 award), confirmed the 2012 award as so modified, and denied the respondents' cross motion to vacate the 2012 award in its entirety. \\u2002Thereafter, the respondent Mendel Brach moved, and the remaining respondents separately moved, for leave to renew their cross motion to vacate the 2012 award. \\u2002In an order dated August 13, 2015, the court granted leave to renew, and upon renewal, in effect, vacated the prior determination denying the respondents' cross motion to vacate the 2012 award and, thereupon, granted the cross motion and remitted the matter to the rabbinical court for a rehearing and a new determination. \\u2003\\u201c\\u2009\\u2018A motion for leave to renew shall be based upon new facts not offered on the prior motion that would change the prior determination and shall contain reasonable justification for the failure to present such facts on the prior motion\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d (Cioffi v.

NYCPD, 85 A.D.3d 1001, 1003, 926 N.Y.S.2d 121). \\u2003Here, in support of their renewal motions, the respondents submitted answers to interrogatories obtained in a separate civil action. \\u2002Those answers were given by an attorney who had represented the petitioners in connection with the underlying transactions, and were not available to the respondents at the time they made their cross motion to vacate the 2012 award. \\u2002Contrary to the Supreme Court's determination, the facts adduced from those interrogatory answers were merely cumulative with respect to the factual material submitted in connection with the respondents' cross motion, and did not demonstrate that the petitioners fraudulently concealed material information from the rabbinical court (see Varela v.

On appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in its classification, valuation, and distribution of the parties\\u2019 property and in granting defendant Gertha\\u2009 Watson (\\u201cWife\\u201d) an unequal distribution of martial property. Because the trial court\\u2019s findings of fact do not support its conclusions of law and because the distributional factors found by the trial court are based upon some of those erroneous findings and conclusions, we reverse the equitable distribution order and remand for entry of a new equitable distribution order. Background Husband and Wife were married in November 1989. Although the trial court\\u2019s equitable distribution order found the date of separation as October 2007, the parties stipulated in the final pretrial order to a date of separation of October 2009. Husband filed a claim for divorce and equitable distribution on 2 April 2015. On 1 June 2015, Wife filed her answer and counterclaims for post separation support, alimony, unequal distribution of marital property, and attorney\\u2019s fees. A hearing was held on 25 October 2016. Following the hearing, the trial court entered an equitable distribution order on 28 February 2017, which granted an unequal distribution in Wife\\u2019s favor. Husband timely appealed to this Court. Analysis Husband argues that the trial court erred in valuing and distributing a portion of the parties\\u2019 marital property and in granting Wife an unequal distribution of the marital property. The parties had only a few assets and one debt in contention. They had a home acquired a year before the marriage as joint tenants; the trial court found the marital home is \\u201cseparate property held by a joint tenancy between the parties\\u201d but distributed the house to Wife and ordered Husband to execute any documents necessary to remove his name from the title and to pay the Home Equity Line of Credit (\\u201cHELOC\\u201d), which was secured by the marital home during the marriage, in a timely manner. The trial court also found that \\u201c[t]here is considerable equity in the marital residence which is marital property.\\u201d The trial court found the HELOC debt is Husband\\u2019s separate debt but found that it was \\u201cwithout any sufficient/or and competent evidence\\u201d of the remaining balance as of the date of separation to determine the payoff, although it made findings of the balance owed as of May 2015 of $42,689.58. Husband also had a 401K plan with his employer which the trial court classified as marital property but again, the trial court found \\u201c[t]here is no sufficient and competent evidence to value [Husband\\u2019s] 401K\\u201d as of the date of separation. The other item in contention is a Cadillac El Dorado, which is marital property. Husband challenges some findings of fact as unsupported by the evidence and some conclusions of law as unsupported by the facts. He also argues that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering an unequal distribution based upon its erroneous findings of fact. Our review of an equitable distribution order is limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in distributing the parties\\u2019 marital property. Accordingly, the findings of fact are conclusive if they are supported by any competent evidence from the record. However, even applying this generous standard of review, there are still requirements with which trial courts must comply. Under N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250\\u201320(c), equitable distribution is a three-step process; the trial court must (1) determine what is marital and divisible property; (2) find the net value of the property; and (3) make an equitable distribution of that property. \\u2024 In fact, to enter a proper equitable distribution judgment, the trial court must specifically and particularly classify and value all assets and debts maintained by the parties at the date of separation. In determining the value of the property, the trial court must consider the property\\u2019s market value, if any, less the amount of any encumbrance serving to offset or reduce the market value. Furthermore, in doing all these things the court must be specific and detailed enough to enable a reviewing court to determine what was done and its correctness. Robinson v. Robinson, 210 N.C. App. 319, 322-23, 707 S.E.2d 785, 789 (2011) (citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted). As to the actual distribution ordered by the trial court, when reviewing an equitable distribution order the standard of review is limited to a determination of whether there was a clear abuse of discretion. A trial court may be reversed for abuse of discretion only upon a showing that its actions are manifestly unsupported by reason. Stovall v. Stovall, 205 N.C. App. 405, 407-08, 698 S.E.2d 680, 683 (2010) (citations, quotation marks, and brackets omitted). I.\\u2003Classification issues Although Husband does not clearly identify an issue of classification of property, his arguments are largely based upon the trial court\\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding classification. Neither the order nor Husband\\u2019s brief separates the issues of classification, valuation, and distribution, but to review the issues, we must separate them. \\u201c[E]quitable distribution is a three-step process; the trial court must (1) determine what is marital and divisible property; (2) find the net value of the property; and (3) make an equitable distribution of that property.\\u201d Robinson, 210 N.C. App. at 323, 707 S.E.2d at 789 (citation, quotation marks, and brackets omitted). Husband argues the trial court erred by distributing the home to Wife and ordering him to remove his name from the deed and pay the HELOC, and his argument is primarily based upon the unequal distribution factors found by the trial court. But first, we must consider the classification of the home. The order is internally contradictory on the classification of the home. The trial court found that the home is \\u201cseparate property held by a joint tenancy between the parties.\\u201d Separate property cannot be distributed in equitable distribution. See Langston v. Richardson, 206 N.C. App. 216, 220, 696 S.E.2d 867, 871 (2010) (\\u201cUnder N.C. Gen. Stat. Sec. 50\\u201320(c), only marital property is subject to distribution. The trial court must classify and identify property as marital or separate depending upon the proof presented to the trial court of the nature of the assets.\\u201d (Citations and quotation marks omitted)\\u2009). But then the trial court also found that \\u201cthere is considerable equity in the marital residence which is marital property.\\u201d But if there is marital equity in the home, the trial court must value the marital interest before distributing it. See Turner v. Turner, 64 N.C. App. 342, 345, 307 S.E.2d 407, 408-09 (1983) (\\u201cUnder G.S. 50-20(c), equitable distribution applies only to the net value of marital property. This requires the trial court to first ascertain what is marital property, then to find the net value of that property, and finally to make a distribution based upon the equitable goals of the statute and the various factors specified therein.\\u201d). And if the home itself is separate property, as the trial court found, it is not subject to distribution, yet the trial court distributed it to Wife, making essentially the same error as the court in Turner: If the house was purchased by plaintiff before the marriage, as the finding states, then it was error to subject the house, as such, to equitable distribution, since under G.S. 50-20(a)(2), property acquired by a spouse before marriage is \\u201cseparate,\\u201d rather than \\u201cmarital,\\u201d property. If, however, an equity in this property developed during the marriage because of improvements or payments contributed to by defendant, that equity (as distinguished from a mere increase in value of separate property, excluded by the statute) could be marital property, in our opinion, upon appropriate, supportable findings being made. And if not marital property, such equity, if it developed, would be a factor requiring consideration by the court, along with the other factors specified in the statute, before determining how much of the marital property each party is entitled to receive. \\u2024 But the findings made do not support the division ordered. Turner, 64 N.C. App. at 346, 307 S.E.2d at 409. The trial court therefore erred by distributing the home, and on remand, the trial court should follow the process set forth in Turner to classify and value the home and any marital or separate interests in the home and to distribute any marital interest. A.\\u2003Cadillac El Dorado Husband contends that the trial court\\u2019s finding of fact valuing the 1995 Cadillac El Dorado at $10,000.00 is not supported by the evidence. We agree there is no evidence to support a finding of the value of the car as $10,000.00 as of the date of separation. The final pretrial order included schedules \\u201csetting out the parties\\u2019 contentions as to the nature and values of the marital property.\\u201d Wife valued the 1995 Cadillac at $1,880.00; Husband also valued the Cadillac at $1,880.00. Husband argues the parties \\u201cstiplulated\\u201d to the value so the court was bound by the stipulation. Wife counters that the parties did not sign the pretrial order and did not stipulate to values, although they both listed the same value. We agree that the pretrial order does not include a formal \\u201cstipulation\\u201d of value, but both parties alleged the same value. And the Pretrial Order did not purport to be a consent order which should be signed by the parties; it was entered based upon the pretrial conference held on 24 November 2015, and Wife claims no impropriety in the trial court\\u2019s entry of the pretrial order. The only evidence of the sum of $10,000.00 was Husband\\u2019s testimony he had paid off a $10,000.00 balance of the loan on the vehicle with a portion of the proceeds from the HELOC, which he received in 2005, four years prior to the date of separation. But a loan payoff on a vehicle years prior to separation is not evidence of the fair market value of the vehicle on the date of separation. See generally Walter v. Walter, 149 N.C. App. 723, 733, 561 S.E.2d 571, 577 (2002) (\\u201cIn an equitable distribution proceeding, the trial court is to determine the net fair market value of the property based on the evidence offered by the parties.\\u201d). On remand, the court should value the car based upon the evidence of fair market value as of the date of separation, and it appears that $1,880.00 is the only evidence of value as of the date of separation. See generally Warren v. Warren, 175 N.C. App. 509, 515, 623 S.E.2d 800, 804 (2006) (\\u201cIn equitable distribution proceedings, marital property must be valued as of the date of the separation of the parties.\\u201d (Citation and quotation marks omitted)\\u2009). B.\\u2003Valuation of home equity, HELOC, and 401K plan Husband addresses this issue as part of his argument regarding unequal distribution factors, but as noted above, the issue originates in the classification and valuation, or lack thereof, of these items and the order\\u2019s distribution of these assets. Equitable distribution is a three-step process: classification, valuation, and distribution. See generally Robinson, 210 N.C. App. at 323, 707 S.E.2d at 789. These three steps must be taken in order, so if the evidence is not sufficient to classify or value an item of property or debt, it cannot distributed. See, e.g., Estate of Nelson ex rel. Brewer v. Nelson, 179 N.C. App. 166, 168-69, 633 S.E.2d 124, 127 (2006) (\\u201cFailure to follow these steps carefully and in sequence may render the findings and conclusions inadequate, erroneous, or both.\\u201d), aff\\u2019d per curiam, 361 N.C. 346, 643 S.E.2d 587 (2007). Husband took out a HELOC secured by the marital home during the marriage, but the trial court found that the HELOC is Husband\\u2019s separate debt based upon its findings regarding Husband\\u2019s sole control over the HELOC and his use of the funds. The trial court was unable to value the outstanding debt as of the date of separation because there was not sufficient evidence of this value. But since the HELOC was classified as a separate debt, it need not be valued and cannot be distributed. See, e.g., Smith v. Smith, 111 N.C. App. 460, 509-10, 433 S.E.2d 196, 226 (1993) (citations omitted) (\\u201cIn determining an equitable distribution, the trial court must consider the debts of the parties. If the debt is a separate debt of one of the parties, then the court must consider it pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)(1). If the debt is a marital debt, that is, a debt incurred during the marriage for the joint benefit of the parties, then it must be valued and distributed.\\u201d (Citations and quotation marks omitted)\\u2009), rev\\u2019d in part on other grounds, 336 N.C. 575, 444 S.E.2d 420 (1994). Classification of property and debt comes first, and only marital property or debt is subject to the next two steps of valuation and distribution. See, e.g., Wall v. Wall, 140 N.C. App. 303, 307-08, 536 S.E.2d 647, 650 (2000) (\\u201cWe continue to stress the importance of following the steps of first classifying, then valuing and distributing marital property. Each step is a prerequisite to the performance of the next, and failure to follow the prescribed order will result in a fatally flawed trial court disposition. Only those assets and debts that are classified as marital property and valued are subject to distribution under the Equitable Distribution Act[.]\\u201d (Citation and quotation marks omitted)\\u2009). In this case, the trial court found there was not \\u201csufficient and competent evidence to value [Husband\\u2019s] 401K\\u201d as of the date of separation. Husband agrees with this finding, since it would be to his benefit, except that the trial court also used the 401K as a factor justifying the unequal distribution. Wife agrees the trial court did not have sufficient evidence to value the 401K, but she argues that it need not be valued to be a distributional factor. She is correct that the trial court need not value items used as distributional factors. See Gum v. Gum, 107 N.C. App. 734, 739, 421 S.E.2d 788, 791 (1992) (\\u201cThe trial court is required to consider evidence of such contributions as a distributional factor according to N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250\\u201320(c)(8). There is no language within \\u00a7 [50-20(c)\\u2009] which would indicate that the trial court is required to place a monetary value on any distributional factor and we decline to impose such an unnecessary burden upon the trial court.\\u201d). But marital property must be valued, see, e.g., Robinson, 210 N.C. App. at 324, 707 S.E.2d at 790 (\\u201cIt is not enough that evidence can be found within the record which could support such classification; the court must actually classify all of the property and make a finding as to the value of all marital property.\\u201d), and the trial court found that 401K plan was marital property but did not value it. If the 401K is not marital property, the trial court could have used it as a distributional factor without valuing it; but if it is marital property, it must first be valued as part of the marital estate. See generally Gum, 107 N.C. App. at 739, 421 S.E.2d at 791; Robinson, 210 N.C. App. at 324, 707 S.E.2d at 790. There is no way to know if the distribution of the marital estate is equal or unequal if there is no finding on the net value of the entire marital estate. The trial court determines the credibility and weight of the evidence, see, e.g., Brackney v. Brackney, 199 N.C. App. 375, 390, 682 S.E.2d 401, 410 (2009) (\\u201c[I]t is well-established \\u2024 that when the trial court is the trier of fact, the court is empowered to assign weight to the evidence presented at the trial as it deems appropriate.\\u201d (Citation, quotation marks, and brackets omitted)\\u2009), and it is possible the trial court did not believe Husband\\u2019s evidence regarding the value of the 401K. But we are concerned that the trial court\\u2019s finding might be based upon the erroneous date of separation in the order. There was evidence, in the form of a letter from the 401K plan administrator, MassMutual Retirement Services Division, of the vested balance of the 401K as of 31 October 2009, the month of the parties\\u2019 separation. Yet the trial court found the parties separated in October 2007. The trial court would be correct there was no evidence of the value of the 401K in 2007\\u2014but that is not the relevant year because the parties did not separate until 2009. Wife contends the finding of the year 2007 is merely a non-prejudicial clerical error. But considering the trial court\\u2019s finding of a lack of evidence of the value of the 401K as of the date of separation, along with the evidence of a letter from the 401K plan administrator valuing the plan as of the date of separation, we cannot say for sure the date error is nonprejudicial. Again, it is possible the trial court did not rely upon the 401K plan administrator\\u2019s letter for some other reason, and that would be within the trial court\\u2019s discretion, but since we are vacating this order for other reasons, on remand, the trial court should clarify its findings regarding the valuation of the 401K as of the date of separation or its inability to value the plan. III.\\u2003Unequal Distribution of the Marital Property Husband contends that the trial court abused its discretion in granting Wife an unequal distribution because the primary findings of factors supporting the unequal distribution are legally and factually incorrect. Based upon the errors in classification and valuation discussed above, including the absence of a finding of the total value of the net marital estate, we must vacate the order and remand for entry of a new order, but we will address Husband\\u2019s argument to avoid potential errors regarding the distributional factors on remand. North Carolina General Statutes Section 50-20(c) sets out the factors the trial court should consider when determining whether an equal division is equitable. See N.C. Gen. Stat. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c) (2017). \\u201cWhere the trial court decides that an unequal distribution is equitable, the court must exercise its discretion to decide how much weight to give each factor supporting an unequal distribution. A single distributional factor may support an unequal division.\\u201d Mugno v. Mugno, 205 N.C. App. 273, 278, 695 S.E.2d 495, 499 (2010) (citations omitted). Here, the trial court determined that an unequal distribution of the marital and divisible property was equitable, and the court found these factors as justification for an unequal division: 35. N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)\\u2014Distributional Factors: That in considering whether an equal distribution would be equitable, the Court has considered all of the evidence presented by the parties relating to the statutory factors set out in Chapter 50-20(c) of the North Carolina General Statutes (as more particularly set out in the findings of fact contained in this judgment), and specifically including the following: a. N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)(1): At the time that the property division is to become effective, [Husband] is employed and will have received the majority of his 401K from Electro Switch, as well as having received the majority of, if not all of the benefit for the funds borrowed against the marital residence via the HELOC. [Wife] is receiving the marital residence. b. N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)(2): There is no obligation for support arising out of a prior marriage. c. N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)(3): The parties were married eighteen (18) years. Both parties are in good mental health. Both parties are limited in what they may do for employment although [Husband] continues to work. \\u2024 e. N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)(5): [Husband] has obtained loans on his 401K, has received a substantial portion of it to date to the exclusion of [Wife], and will receive all that remains of it. f. N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)(6): Both parties contributed to the purchase of the Marital residence and its eventual pay off. \\u2024 i. N.C.G.S. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c)(9): The 401K and the equity that remains in the residence are the largest Liquid assets the parties have. There is no sufficient and competent evidence to value [Husband\\u2019s] 401K, the exact amount of principle (sic) remaining on the HELOC and as a result the exact amount of equity in the Marital Residence. \\u2024 36. An equal distribution of marital and divisible property is not equitable in this matter. The court found that \\u201c[n]o evidence was presented\\u201d regarding any of the other factors in N.C. Gen. Stat. \\u00a7\\u200250-20(c). The primary factor the trial court used to justify an unequal distribution was (i), but the trial court\\u2019s finding \\u201c[t]he 401K and the equity that remains in the residence are the largest Liquid assets the parties have\\u201d presents several problems. First, neither of these marital assets was valued, as discussed above. The second problem is either a serious clerical error or a misunderstanding of the meaning of the term \\u201cliquid.\\u201d Black\\u2019s Law Dictionary defines a liquid asset as \\u201c[a]n asset that is readily convertible to cash, such as a marketable security, a note, or an account receivable.\\u201d Black\\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). In comparison, an illiquid asset is defined as \\u201c[a]n asset that is not readily convertible into cash, usu. because of (1) the lack of demand, (2) the absence of an established market, or (3) the substantial cost or time required for liquidation (such as real property, even when it is desirable).\\u201d Illiquid asset, Black\\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th Ed. 2014) (emphasis added). A 401K plan is not liquid since it is not readily accessible and any withdrawals prior to retirement incur substantial taxes and penalties. Equity in a home is not liquid because the home must be sold to get access to the equity. See e.g., Robertson v. Robertson, 167 N.C. App. 567, 571, 605 S.E.2d 667, 669-70 (2004) (\\u201cAlthough the trial court found defendant could liquidate the above assets to pay the $52,100.07 distributive award, the only liquid assets readily available to pay the award were two bank accounts totaling $5,929.38. Wife\\u2019s other assets included stock in PSI valued at $37,336.00, the unencumbered one-half acre lot valued at $8,920.00, and the personal property valued at $13,829.68. With the exception of the pension plan, which the trial court found would be difficult to liquidate and might cause unfavorable tax consequences, the trial court failed to make findings concerning the difficulty and possible financial and tax consequences of borrowing money against or liquidating the PSI stock, the one-half acre lot, and the personal property in order to pay the amount of the judgment lien within ninety days. Accordingly, although Wife may in fact be able to pay the distributive award, her evidence is sufficient to raise the question of whether adjusting the award from her to Husband is necessary to offset any adverse financial consequences of using the non-liquid assets.\\u201d (Citations, quotation marks, brackets, and ellipses omitted)\\u2009). As discussed above on valuation, the remainder of the finding on factor (i) is also erroneous because the marital property was not valued. The trial court found it could not value the marital equity in the home or the 401K plan. It found there was \\u201cno sufficient and competent evidence to value [Husband]\\u2019s 401K\\u201d and that the exact amount of principal remaining on the HELOC and the equity in the marital residence were also unknown. Without valuation of the marital assets, it is impossible to say if a distribution is equal or unequal. See generally Crowder v. Crowder, 147 N.C. App. 677, 681, 556 S.E.2d 639, 642 (2001) (\\u201cThe distribution of marital assets entails the court\\u2019s determination of an \\u2018equitable\\u2019 division of marital property. The marital property is to be distributed equally, unless the court determines equal is not equitable.\\u201d (Citation and quotation marks omitted)\\u2009). Yet the court nevertheless used these unvalued marital assets in its determination that an unequal distribution was equitable, as evidenced in findings (a), (e), (f), and (i). Once those findings discussed above are removed, we are left only with its findings: (b) that \\u201c[t]here is no obligation for support arising out of a prior marriage\\u201d and (c) that \\u201c[t]he parties were married eighteen (18) years. Both parties are in good mental health. Both parties are limited in what they may do for employment although [Husband] continues to work.\\u201d These factors are essentially descriptions of the parties\\u2019 circumstances and while they are relevant, they cannot, standing alone, support the trial court\\u2019s conclusion that an unequal distribution is equitable. Since the court based an \\u201cunequal\\u201d distribution on marital assets that were not valued and on a misunderstanding of \\u201cliquid\\u201d assets, we hold that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering an unequal distribution. IV.\\u2003Conclusion The trial court\\u2019s order on equitable distribution is reversed and we remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand, within 30 days after mandate issues on this opinion, either party may file a written request with the trial court for a hearing to present additional evidence or argument, and if a party files a timely request, the trial court shall hold a hearing to \\u201cto hear arguments and receive evidence from both parties on remand, in order to address the errors discussed above and to properly identify, classify, and value the parties\\u2019 property as required by statutory law and case law.\\u201d Dalgewicz v. Dalgewicz, 167 N.C. App. 412, 424, 606 S.E.2d 164, 172 (2004). If neither party files a timely written request for hearing on remand, the trial court may, in its sole discretion, determine whether to hold an additional hearing or to enter a new order based upon the evidence presented at the prior hearing.

The primary issue is whether Plaintiff Pueblo of Jemez has the exclusive right to use, occupy, and possess the lands of the Valles Caldera National Preserve (\\u201cValles Caldera\\u201d) pursuant to its allegedly unextinguished and continuing aboriginal title to those lands. The Court concludes that Jemez Pueblo has not established aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera. Although the evidence proves that Jemez Pueblo has actually and continuously used and occupied the Valles Caldera for a long time, the evidence also shows that many Pueblos and Tribes also used the Valles Caldera in ways that defeat Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim. FINDINGS OF FACT All parties have submitted proposed findings of fact. See Plaintiff's, Defendant's, and Defendant-In-Intervention New Mexico Gas Company's Joint Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, filed April 15, 2019 (Doc. 384)(\\u201cJoint Proposed Findings\\u201d); Plaintiff Pueblo of Jemez's Proposed Findings of Fact, filed April 15, 2019 (Doc. 388)(\\u201cJemez Pueblo's Proposed Findings\\u201d); United States' Proposed Findings of Fact, filed April 15, 2019 (Doc. 386)(\\u201cUnited States' Proposed Findings\\u201d). The Court has carefully considered all three sets of proposed findings and accepts some of those findings, rejects some, and finds some facts that no party brought to its attention. The Court sets forth its findings below. 1.\\u2003The Valles Caldera Geology. 1.\\u2003The Valles Caldera is a volcanic crater in the center of the Jemez Mountains, State of New Mexico. See Trial Transcript at 75:1-5 (taken Oct. 29, 2018), filed December 20, 2018 (Doc. 337)(\\u201cOct. 29 Tr.\\u201d)(Fogleman); Pueblo of Jemez Expert Witness Report by William Fogleman at 4-5 (undated), admitted October 29, 2018, at trial as Jemez Pueblo's Ex. 187 (\\u201cFogleman Report\\u201d). 2.\\u2003Approximately 1.2 million years ago, a series of volcanos erupted, which spread ash and pyroclastic flow\\u2009 that drained out the top part of the magma chamber. See Oct. 29 Tr. at 75:1-13 (Fogleman); Fogleman Report at 4; Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Memorandum Opinion and Order at 2 n.1, filed October 25, 2018 (Doc. 317) (\\u201cOct. 25 MOO\\u201d), 350 F. Supp. 3d 1052, 1056 n.1 (D.N.M. 2018)(Browning, J.). 3.\\u2003Volcanologists classify the Valles Caldera as a young caldera. See Oct. 29 Tr. at 75:1-2 (Fogleman); Fogleman Report at 4. 4.\\u2003The Valles Caldera is an active volcano. See, e.g., Oct. 29 Tr. at 75:1-2 (Fogleman); Fogleman Report at 4-5. 5.\\u2003The volcano's upper magma chamber lacked magma, which effected a collapse that resulted in the empty crater that today is known as the Valles Caldera. See Oct. 29 Tr. at 75:1-13 (Fogleman); Fogleman Report at 4-5; Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 2 n.1, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1056 n.1. 6.\\u2003After the magma chamber collapsed, a lake formed over the caldera floor. See Oct. 29 Tr. at 75:25-76:5 (Fogleman); Fogleman Report at 5. 7.\\u2003The lake drained from the caldera when the caldera's southwest rim eroded. See Oct. 29 Tr. at 76:20-25 (Fogleman). 8.\\u2003The caldera lake's drainage helped to form the Jemez River valley. See Oct. 29 Tr. at 76:22-77:11 (Fogleman); Fogleman Report at 7. 9.\\u2003The caldera rim's southwest region is the caldera base's lowest elevation. See Oct. 29 Tr. at 77:12-19 (Fogleman); id. at 85:5-12. 10.\\u2003The Jemez River headwaters are in the Valles Caldera. See Trial Transcript at 1813:5-6 (taken Nov. 6, 2018), filed January 15, 2019 (Doc. 343)(\\u201cNov. 6 Tr.\\u201d)(Ferguson). 11.\\u2003The East Fork Jemez River waters, which include Jaramillo Creek, La Jara Creek, Redondo Creek, Rito de los Indios, San Antonio Creek, and Sulphur Creek, flow into the Jemez River. See Fogleman Report at 7. 12.\\u2003Springs, streams, and rivers are an expression of groundwater elevation. See Oct. 29 Tr. at 84:12-24 (Fogleman). 13.\\u2003A spring or river is where groundwater is exposed to the land surface, and such areas are marshy. See Oct. 29 Tr. at 84:12-24 (Fogleman). 14.\\u2003The caldera rim is approximately twelve to thirteen miles in diameter. See Oct. 29 Tr. at 76:12-15 (Fogleman); Fogleman Report at 4. 15.\\u2003Redondo Peak is a resurgent magma dome that formed when magma pushed up the caldera floor. See Oct. 29 Tr. at 75:25-76:5 (Fogleman); id. at 85:13-22 (Fogleman); Fogleman Report at 5. 16.\\u2003The caldera's elevation ranges from 7,000 feet in the southwest region to 11,254 feet at Redondo Peak. See Oct. 29 Tr. 77:12-19 (Fogleman); Fogleman Report at 4. 17.\\u2003The Valles Caldera includes four of Merriam's life-zones: (i) the Subalpine Zone at 9,500 to 11,500 feet, which has cooler temperatures, and allows for Spruce trees and Fir forests, and wildlife that includes bighorn sheep and unique small animal species which tend to live at higher elevations; (ii) the Coniferous Forest Zone at 8,500 to 9,500 feet, which is the caldera's predominant zone and consists of hydrologic features and wildlife that includes beavers, raccoons, black bear, and elk; (iii) the Mountain Transition Zone at 7,000 to 8,500 feet, which permits predominately Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir, and wildlife that includes mule deer and horned owl; and (iv) the Grassland/Woodlands Zone at 4,500 to 7,000 feet, which permits tall grasslands and wildlife that includes turkey, jackrabbits, foxes, and mountain lions. See Oct. 29 Tr. at 79:12-82:4 (Fogleman); Fogleman Report at 5-6. 18.\\u2003Most of the Valles Caldera is inside the caldera rim, including four high-mountain valleys and at least ten volcanic domes, which are located within the Valles Caldera's exterior boundaries as Congress established pursuant to the Valles Caldera Preservation Act, 114 Stat. 598. See Valles Caldera Preservation Act of 2000, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 698v-698v-10 (repealed 2014)(\\u201cPreservation Act\\u201d). 2.\\u2003Valles Caldera Conveyances. 19.\\u2003When the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the Mexican-American War in 1848, the United States formally acquired New Mexico, which was subsequently organized under a territorial government. See Kurt Anschuetz and Thomas Merlan, More Than a Scenic Mountain Landscape: Valles Caldera National Preserve Land Use History 27 (dated 2007), admitted October 29, 2018, at trial as United States' Ex. DX-KX (\\u201cVCNP Land Use History\\u201d). 20.\\u2003In the Act of June 21, 1860, 12 Stat. 71, Congress authorized Luis Maria de Baca's heirs to select up to five square tracts of vacant land within the New Mexico Territory totaling up to 496,447 acres. See Act of June 21, 1860, 12 Stat. 71 (\\u201c1860 Act\\u201d); Trial Transcript at 3516:17-18 (taken Nov. 15, 2018), filed February 11, 2019 (Doc. 357)(\\u201cNov. 15 Tr.\\u201d)(Garc\\u00eda y Griego); Pueblo of Jemez Expert Witness Report by Terence Kehoe at 10 (dated March 23, 2018), admitted October 29, 2018, at trial as Jemez Pueblo's Ex. 193 (\\u201cKehoe Report\\u201d). 21.\\u2003In December, 1860, the Baca heirs selected their first parcels -- known as \\u201cBaca Location No. 1\\u201d -- an area totaling approximately 99,289 acres of land in and adjacent to the Valles Caldera. Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 7, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1060 (citing United States v. Redondo Dev. Co., 254 F. 656, 657 (8th Cir. 1918)). 22.\\u2003On September 30, 1876, the General Land Office approved the first Baca Location No. 1 survey. See Surveyor General's Office, Santa Fe, New Mexico, Field Notes of the Survey of Baca Location No. 1 at 15 (dated Sept. 30, 1876), admitted October 29, 2018, at trial as United States' Ex. DX-Q. 23.\\u2003In January, 1899, the District Court of the County of Bernalillo, Territory of New Mexico, ordered Baca Location No. 1's sale at public auction to the highest bidder. See Kehoe Report at 13. 24.\\u2003On March 18, 1899, the District Court of the County of Bernalillo, Territory of New Mexico approved Baca Location No. 1's sale to Frank Clancy, who on the same day sold Baca Location No. 1 to the Valles Land Company, which Mariano Otero and his son owned. See Kehoe Report at 13; Order Approving Report and Confirming Sale, Whitney v. Otero at 1-2 (dated March 18, 1899), admitted October 29, 2018, at trial as United States' Ex. DX-Y; Bargain & Sale Deed, F. Clancy to Valles Land Co. at 100 (dated March 18, 1899), admitted October 29, 2018, at trial as United States' Ex.

See Mem. of Agreement Between Redondo Development Co. and Frank and G. Bond for the Sale of Baca Location No. 1 at 276-81 (dated Dec. 14, 1918), admitted November 16, 2018, at trial as United States' Ex. DX-DJ; Nov. 16 Tr. at 3993:4-3995:16 (Kehoe) 27.\\u2003The Baca Location No. 1 sales agreement excluded the tract's forest resources, reserving to Redondo Development and its successors the right to remove and sell all timber for a ninety-nine-year period. See Mem. of Agreement Between Redondo Development Co. and Frank and G. Bond for the Sale of Baca Location No. 1 at 276-81; Nov. 16 Tr. at 3993:4-3995:16 (Kehoe). 28.\\u2003The Bonds assumed possession of Baca Location 1 on January 1, 1919.

PX 154 (\\u201cLandscapes of Signification\\u201d). 100.\\u2003The simplest explanation for Cerro del Medio obsidian's widespread distribution is that various Tribes' members obtained it from the source. See Nov. 13 Tr. at 3088:16-3089:13 (Steffen)(\\u201cCertainly the simplest explanation is that people just came in and got [Cerro del Medio obsidian].\\u201d); Steffen Report at 6. 101.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo has never controlled the Cerro del Medio obsidian source.

Multiple Pueblos and Tribes Conceive Their Ancestral Territory as Encompassing Sizable Valles Caldera Segments. 116.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo elders historically considered the Valles Caldera as a sacred domain over which no single Pueblo or Tribe was the sole proprietor, because ownership was cooperative rather than exclusive. See, e.g., Trial Transcript at 1108:6-11 (taken Nov. 1, 2018), filed January 11, 2019 (Doc. 340)(\\u201cNov. 1 Tr.\\u201d)(Leonard, Weslowski)(affirming that the Pueblos \\u201cunderstand[\\u2009] lands as a commons, rather than owned by one group or one person\\u201d); id. at 1112:11-16 (Leonard, Weslowski). 117.\\u2003Pueblo peoples have had a mutual responsibility to use the land's natural resources in a spiritually \\u201ccorrect\\u201d manner; and through this correct stewardship, many different people have cooperatively used the same region without competitive conflict.

See, e.g., Nov. 4 Tr. at 358:25-359:17 (Luebben, Whatley). 119.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo elders did not agree on the significance of every location that the Ancestral Land Project considered.

PX 122 (\\u201cArcheology of the Jemez Province\\u201d). 127.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo has not maintained consistently that the entire Valles Caldera belongs exclusively to Jemez Pueblo. See Kehoe Rebuttal Report at 10 (\\u201cSignificantly, the assertions of exclusive Jemez Indian ownership of the Valles Caldera in these recent depositions contradicts the public positions taken in earlier periods by some Jemez Indians, who described sharing these lands equally with other pueblos.\\u201d); id. at 11 (\\u201cFormer Jemez Governor Toya repeatedly referred to the joint use of shrines and other areas with Baca Location 1 by the Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana, and Zia.\\u201d). 128.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo never asserted to the Dunigan family that it owned the Valles Caldera.

See, e.g., Nov. 14 Tr. at 3378:15-3379:25 (Luebben, Garc\\u00eda y Griego); Garc\\u00eda y Griego Report at 23 (depicting a copy and reconstruction of a 1602 map of New Mexico that includes numerous Pueblos' locations). 141.\\u2003Although between 1598 and 1601 C.E., Spanish missionaries established a small mission at Guisewa, in modern-day Jemez Springs, they were unable to minister effectively to Jemez Pueblo until they built a mission at Walatowa in 1620. See, e.g., Oct. 30 Tr. at 366:19-25 (Liebmann); Garc\\u00eda y Griego Report at 25. 142.\\u2003The Spanish, beginning in 1598 and culminating in 1621 C.E., forced Jemez Pueblo from its dispersed mountain communities into modern-day Walatowa. See, e.g., Nov. 14 Tr. at 3378:15-19 (Garc\\u00eda y Griego); id. at 3380:2-6 (Luebben, Garc\\u00eda y Griego). 143.\\u2003The Spanish removed Jemez Pueblo members to Walatowa to consolidate the rebellious Jemez communities.

See, e.g., Nov. 14 Tr. at 3351:10-12 (Luebben, Garc\\u00eda y Griego); id. at 3395:1-10 (Garc\\u00eda y Griego). 148.\\u2003Spain made its land grant to Jemez Pueblo around 1700 C.E. and measured the grant from Walatowa's center. See, e.g., Nov. 14 Tr. at 3449:6-17 (Leonard, Garc\\u00eda y Griego); id. at 3450:21-25 (Garc\\u00eda y Griego). 149.\\u2003Although Spain granted some Pueblos more than 17,500 acres based on aboriginal title claims, Jemez did not receive additional acres. See, e.g., Nov. 4 Tr. at 3451:6-13 (Leonard, Garc\\u00eda y Griego)(affirming that the Spanish surveyor general recommended that Ysleta Pueblo receive 110,000 acres based on its aboriginal title claim); Garc\\u00eda y Griego Report at 15. 150.\\u2003The Spanish did not recognize a Jemez Pueblo property interest in the Valles Caldera.

See, e.g., Nov. 14 Tr. at 3461:15-3462:3 (Leonard, Garc\\u00eda y Griego); Garc\\u00eda y Griego Report at 37-38 (describing Jemez Pueblo's census results as 3.4 persons per family while other Pueblos averaged up to five people per family). 161.\\u2003Although disease and warfare with the Spanish resulted in Jemez Pueblo's low population, relocation to Walatowa, and removal from the Banco Bonito during the Spanish colonial period, Jemez Pueblo did not cease using the Valles Caldera. See e.g., Oct. 30 Tr. at 436:13-437:25 (Liebmann); Nov. 14 Tr. at 3364:4-10 (Garc\\u00eda y Griego); id. at 3364:11-13 (Garc\\u00eda y Griego). 162.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo's low population during the eighteen and nineteenth centuries made it vulnerable to Navajo and Apache raids on Jemez Pueblo's animals and food. See, e.g., Nov. 14 Tr. at 3372:1-14 (Luebben, Garc\\u00eda y Griego); Garc\\u00eda y Griego Report at 39-40. 163.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo could not defend against Navajo, Apache, Ute, and Comanche attacks throughout the eighteenth century given its diminished military capabilities, which was a function of its small population size. See, e.g., Nov. 15 Tr. at 3364:17-21 (Luebben, Garc\\u00eda y Griego)(\\u201c[T]he military capability of the pueblos, the Hemish and other pueblos, as well, would have been primarily a function of their population size.\\u201d); id. at 3365:14-3366:6 (Luebben, Garc\\u00eda y Griego). 164.\\u2003Navajo, Apache, and Ute Tribes grew in power during the seventeenth century after adopting an equestrian lifestyle, which allowed for an \\u201cescalation in raiding and violence that \\u2024 transformed the Valles Caldera into a dangerous place\\u201d and, among other things, decreased Jemez Pueblo's access to Cerro del Medio obsidian. Oct. 30 Tr. at 585:18-586:25 (Marinelli, Liebmann). See Landscapes of Signification at 656 (\\u201cThe same factors that caused the decrease in Jemez['] use of Cerro del Medio obsidian prior to the 1680 Revolt came into play yet again, with hostilities between the Pueblos and their Navajo and Apache neighbors waxing in the years after the Spanish reconquest of New Mexico.\\u201d). 165.\\u2003The Spanish used Jemez warriors to fight against the Navajos, Apaches, Utes, and Comanche in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and to implement a defensive strategy against Navajo attacks. See, e.g., Nov. 14 Tr. at 3365:14-19 (Garc\\u00eda y Griego); id. at 3369:16-3370:9 (Luebben, Garc\\u00eda y Griego); id. at 3385:2-7 (Garc\\u00eda y Griego). 166.\\u2003Since at least 1300 C.E., Jemez Pueblo lacked the military power and population to prevent Tewa and Keres Pueblos, and more numerous and powerful Navajo and Apache Tribes, from accessing the Valles Caldera. See, e.g., Nov. 30 Tr. at 4729:6-4734:4 (Marinelli, Anschuetz); Anschuetz Rebuttal Report at 26-35. 167.\\u2003The Navajo camped and worshiped in the Valles Caldera, and worshiped at Redondo Peak, because Redondo Peak is the Navajo's sacred eastern mountain.

See, e.g., VCNP Land Use History at 27; Kehoe Report at 7. 176.\\u2003In the late 1800s, Jemez Pueblo stockmen attacked a Navajo group residing in the Valle Grande's southwest corner, killing at least one and driving the others from their Valles Caldera camp. See, e.g., Nov. 19 Tr. at 4213:3-6 (Marinelli, Kehoe); VCNP Land Use History at 27; Ferguson Report at 56. 177.\\u2003The United States Army and associated contractors were the Valles Caldera's only occupants in the 1850s and 1860s, although multiple Pueblos, Tribes and non-Indians wandered throughout the area during this period. See, e.g., 4169:24-4170:8 (Marinelli, Kehoe); Kehoe Report at 8; VCNP Land Use History at 27-28. 178.\\u2003In August, 1863, the United States Army established a military outpost on the Valle Grande (\\u201cValle Grande outpost\\u201d) that operated continuously until May, 1864. See, e.g., Letter from Lieutenant Samuel Barr to Captain Ben Cutler at 1 (dated May 31, 1864), admitted October 29, 2018, at trial as United States' Ex.

See, e.g., Kehoe Report at 40-41; Religious Freedom at 32. 234.\\u2003In the early 1960s, New Mexico Timber responded to legislative and market developments by logging intensively areas within Baca Location No. 1 in a practice called clear-cutting, which removed virtually all trees from the targeted areas. See, e.g., VCNP Land Use History at 130-31; Kehoe Report at 35-37. 235.\\u2003In 1964, Dunigan sued New Mexico Timber in an effort to alter its logging practices.

See Final Envtl. Impact Statement at 692-94 (\\u201cWe can state emphatically that the Santa Clara Pueblo does observe religious ceremonies within the project area. DOE has been unaware of these ceremonies because the Pueblo religious societies come to that area and pray in secrecy in order to preserve the power of their religious ceremonies.\\u201d). 296.\\u2003In 1979, Cochiti Pueblo testified that the Pueblos of Santa Clara, San Juan, San Ildefonso, Tesuque, Jemez, Zia, Santa Ana, Cochiti, and San Felipe had an interest in the Valles Caldera which required the geothermal development project developers to consult with them before taking further action. See, e.g., Nov. 19 Tr. at 4130:15-4131:7 (Marinelli, Kehoe)(stating that Cochiti Pueblo expressed in 1979 that \\u201cmany pueblos in the area have a strong interest in Baca Location,\\u201d and identifying interested Pueblos); Transcript of Public Hearing on Geothermal Demonstration Project at 266 (dated Aug. 30, 1979), admitted October 29, 2018, at trial as Jemez Pueblo's Ex.

See, e.g., Nov. 9 Tr. at 2710:17-2711:22 (West, Suina)(discussing how Cochiti Pueblo purchased lands to effect an exchange for ancestral homelands with the New Mexico State Land Office); Nov. 7 Tr. at 2068:13-25 (Lucero)(discussing how Zia Pueblo through Congressional Act obtained lands adjacent to the Ojito Wilderness); Nov. 9 Tr at 2672:15-2673:3 (Marinelli, Madalena)(affirming that the United States permitted Zia Pueblo to purchase the Ojito Wilderness); Designation of Deposition Testimony -- Gilbert Suazo at 13:13-23, admitted November 15, 2018, at trial as Jemez Pueblo's Proposed Findings PX 559 (Suazo)(discussing Taos Pueblo's appeal to Congress to recover title to Blue Lake, which Congress eventually recognized). 324.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo asked Congress to permit it to purchase 200 acres on Redondo Peak. See, e.g., U.S. Senate, Valles Caldera Preservation Act: Hearing Before the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, 106th Cong. 2nd sess. at 61 (Statement of Raymond Gachupin, Governor, Pueblo of Jemez)(\\u201cIn desperation. Senators, we therefore ask this honorable committee to consider granting us a right to acquire a mere 200-acre tract of land on top of Redondo Peak that encompasses the primary sacred shrine of the Jemez people.\\u201d); Testimony of the Pueblo of Jemez Before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources; Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management at 7 (dated March 10, 2000), admitted October 29, 2018, at trial as United States' Ex.

See, e.g., Nov. 20 Tr. at 4301:1-4302:18 (D. Yepa)(asserting that Jemez Pueblo's purchase request was its \\u201clast effort to get something\\u201d from the United States' Valles Caldera acquisition); id. at 4337:8-22 (D. Yepa); Kehoe Report at 54-56. 327.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo initially proposed an amendment to the Preservation Act that would give it a seat on the Valles Caldera Trust board but the Honorable Pietro \\u201cPete\\u201d V. Domenici, former Senator from the State of New Mexico, resisted Jemez Pueblo's initial proposal, and Jemez Pueblo thereafter proposed a second amendment to reserve an American Indian seat on the board, which Congress ultimately rejected. See, e.g., Testimony of the Pueblo of Jemez Before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management at 3-4 (March 10, 2000), admitted November 19, 2018, at trial as United States' Ex. DX-IE (\\u201cFor your consideration, the Pueblo of Jemez promotes the concept of multiple-use and would honor the opportunity to actively participate on the Valles Caldera Board of Trustees.\\u201d); Nov. 20 Tr. at 4303:13-4304:12 (D. Yepa)(\\u201cJemez wanted a Native American seat. Actually, Jemez wanted a Jemez seat. But, again, in conversations with Senator Domenici, there was some resistance in having just a Jemez seat. And that's why I think that a representative of a federally-recognized Indian tribe or pueblo is in there.\\u201d). 328.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo privately sought to acquire the entire Valles Caldera before the United States purchased the land in 2000, yet officially it supported the United States' efforts thereto. See, e.g., Nov. 5 Tr. at 1551:8-22 (Marinelli, Chinana)(affirming that Jemez Pueblo's congressional testimony said for the record: \\u201cYes, we strongly support the proposed acquisition of the Valles Caldera.\\u201d); id. at 1551:8-12 (Marinelli, Chinana)(affirming that, before Jemez Pueblo's congressional testimony, Jemez Pueblo's Tribal Council \\u201cdiscussed the best way of getting the Valles Caldera back to Jemez\\u201d); Designation of Deposition Testimony -- Allen Gachupin at 115:18-116:21, admitted November 20, 2018, at trial as United States' Ex.

DX-UV (\\u201cAlthough our Indian title remains unextinguished we assumed the 12-year statute of limitation of the Federal Quiet Title Act was a barrier to our recovery of these lands. To our advantage, in 2000, the United States purchased the Baca location from private owners.\\u201d). 329.\\u2003Rather than agreeing to Jemez Pueblo's request for a seat on the Valles Caldera Trust Board or for 200 acres on Redondo Peak, Congress recognized many Tribes' continued interests in the Valles Caldera. See, e.g., Nov. 20 Tr. at 4310:6-15 (D. Yepa)(affirming that, as a Valles Caldera Trust board member, Yepa \\u201chad a duty to consult with all Native American tribes\\u201d); Deposition Testimony -- Allen Gachupin at 101:6-103:2 (Marinelli, Gachupin); State of New Mexico, Senate Floor Amendment to Senate Joint Memorial 11, Forty-Third Legislature, Second Session, at 2 (dated Feb. 5, 1998), admitted October 29, 2018, at trial as United States' Ex.

See, e.g., Dec. 5 Tr. at 5333:23-5334:24 (Leonard, Silva-Ba\\u00f1uelos)(\\u201cA special use permit is a form of authorization that the Park Service uses to provide additional access or permission to do something that is generally not allowed by the general public.

See, e.g., Dec. 5 Tr. at 5335:3-8 (Silva-Ba\\u00f1uelos)(\\u201cThe education permit is free, the research permit is free, the special use permit comes with a requirement for cost recovery -- we have to recover the costs of issuing the permit.

See, e.g., Warranty Deed and Assignment of Rights Under Warranty Deed and Reciprocal Conservation and Access Easement between Dunigan Enterprises et al. and United States of America at 1 (July 25, 2000), admitted October 29, 2018, at trial as United States' Ex. DX-IG; Valles Grande at 122. 334.\\u2003Congress amended the Preservation Act to direct the United States to acquire the Valles Caldera's outstanding mineral interests, which the United States' acquired in 2006 for $3,800,000.00. See, e.g., United States v. Harrell, 642 F.3d 907, 910-11 (10th Cir. 2011); Valles Grande at 123. 335.\\u2003The United States spent approximately $31,000,000.00 between 2000 and 2009 to restore and manage the Valles Caldera, and it has continued to invest in the Valles Caldera since 2009. See, e.g., Government Accountability Office, Valles Caldera: The Trust Has Made Progress but Faces Significant Challenges to Achieve Goals of the Preservation Act at 6 (Oct. 1, 2009), admitted October 29, 2018, at trial as United States' Ex.

See, e.g., Nov. 20 Tr. at 4376:14-15 (Marinelli, Gachupin)(affirming that the Jemez fire chief has \\u201cno clue\\u201d \\u201chow much it cost to fight the Thompson Ridge Fire\\u201d); Nov. 9 Tr. at 2587:4-2588:7 (Marinelli, Madalena)(affirming that Jemez Pueblo does not have the funds to manage the Valles Caldera and that its \\u201cmanagement plan was to rely on the Park Service to pay for management of the Valles Caldera if Jemez wins the lawsuit\\u201d); Nov. 9 Tr. at 2652:12-2653:21 (Luebben, Madalena)(\\u201c[T]he plan would be \\u2024, yes, going to co-management with the Park Service.

See, e.g., Dec. 5 Tr. at 5274:13-18 (Silva-Ba\\u00f1uelos)(\\u201cI also remember Jemez Pueblo at the time as we were considering a change in the management structure for Valles Caldera, that Governor Madalena expressed his interest that if Congress is going to make any changes, that it transfer the Preserve to Jemez Pueblo.\\u201d); id. at 5275:19-5276:1 (Silva-Ba\\u00f1uelos)(\\u201cIn one of my meetings with Governor Madalena, \\u2024 in all the conversations I had with all these entities, that because Congress seemed to be opening the door to a different type of administrative jurisdiction for Valles Caldera, this was the opportunity for everyone to make their pitch.\\u201d); Nov. 9 Tr. at 2595:20-2597:2 (Marinelli, Madalena)(recognizing Congress as the only entity who could \\u201cdeed\\u201d the Valles Caldera to Jemez Pueblo and that Senator Bingaman rejected Jemez Pueblo acquisition). 338.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo made requests to Senator Bingaman and the Honorable Ben Ray Luj\\u00e1n, United States Representative from the State of New Mexico, that Congress extend the Quiet Title Act's statute of limitations to permit Jemez Pueblo to further research its aboriginal title claims, and Senator Bingaman ultimately declined to entertain Jemez Pueblo's requests.

Luebben] contacted Senator Bingaman's office, as well as the office of Congressman Ben Ray Lujan, to ask on behalf of Jemez Pueblo if the senator and the congressman would consider introducing legislation to extend the statute of limitations of the Quiet Title Act.\\u201d); id. at 5286:2-14 (Silva-Ba\\u00f1uelos); Nov. 7 Tr. at 2243:15-2246:9 (Luebben, Madalena)(\\u201c[W]hen I was governor, I went to the extremes in making sure that we reacquire the Valles Caldera. I went \\u2024 beyond my call of duty to work with the Trust, the Preserve, the Park, the United States, \\u2024 to come to some sort of fruition on what we were asking for.\\u201d). 339.\\u2003In 2014, Congress transferred management responsibility for the Valles Caldera from the Valles Caldera Trust to the National Park Service for two primary reasons: (i) to enhance public access given the general public's strong interest to recreate there; and (ii) to protect and preserve the Valles Caldera's archaeological sites and natural and cultural assets. See e.g., Dec. 5 Tr. at 5270:21-5271:5 (Silva-Ba\\u00f1uelos)(\\u201c[W]e ended up landing on the Park Service \\u2024 given the significant interest by the general public to use and access and recreate on the Preserve, as well as our understanding of the wealth of archaeological sites and natural and cultural values that the Preserve had.\\u201d), id. at 5320:1-19 (Silva-Ba\\u00f1uelos)(asserting that, during Congressional consultation about the Valles Caldera transfer, many Tribes desired legislation that would protect the Valles Caldera's fish, wildlife, and watershed resources as well as its historical, cultural, and archaeological values, and other groups expressed similar concern for protecting such resources, including hunting organizations and environmental organizations); id. at 5330:11-5331:16 (Marinelli, Silva-Ba\\u00f1uelos)(describing how the Valles Caldera Trust raffled hunting access to the Valles Caldera through a lottery system, which led to the impression that wealthy hunters had an advantage given the number of tickets they could purchase). 340.\\u2003Upon assuming management, the Valles Caldera Trust implemented a closure order over the entire Valles Caldera and thereafter gradually opened discrete areas to the public for specific activities while leaving the remaining lands closed to public access; National Park Service management takes an opposite approach -- the entire Valles Caldera is open for non-motorized, public access on foot unless the National Park Service closes a specific area or prohibits a specific activity. See, e.g., Dec. 5 Tr. at 5316:3-5317:8 (Marinelli, Silva-Ba\\u00f1uelos); Backcountry Access, Valles Caldera, National Park Service, https://www.nps.gov/vall/planyourvisit/backcountry-access.htm (last visited June 6, 2018). 341.\\u2003In addition to Jemez Pueblo, the Pueblos of Santa Clara, Zia, Cochiti, San Felipe, Santo Domingo, Ohkay Owingeh, San Ildefonso, and Jicarilla Apache\\u2009 consulted Congress on the proposed Valles Caldera National Preserve transfer legislation, and discussed their historical, traditional, and cultural uses of the Valles Caldera.

It also includes a bench trial; oral closing arguments, see Clerk's Minutes, filed March 7, 2019 (Doc. 392); and proposed FOFs and COLs. 1.\\u2003The Complaint. 3.\\u2003On July 20, 2012, Jemez Pueblo filed its Complaint. See Complaint at 1. Jemez Pueblo asserts that the United States' claim of title to the Valles Caldera \\u201cis subject to Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal Indian title right of possession, use and occupancy that has existed since prehistoric times.\\u201d Specifically, Jemez Pueblo alleges aboriginal title to \\u201cthat certain parcel of land commonly known as Baca Location No. 1 located in Sandoval and Rio Arriba Counties, New Mexico \\u2024 containing 99,289.39 acres, more or less.\\u201d Complaint at 27. 4.\\u2003In the Complaint, Jemez Pueblo asserts three distinct claims for relief under the federal common law and the Quiet Title Act, 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2409a (\\u201cQTA\\u201d). First, Jemez Pueblo asks the Court to \\u201c[e]nter a judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2409a that Plaintiff has the exclusive right to use, occupy and possess the lands of the Valles Caldera National Preserve pursuant to its continuing aboriginal Indian title to such lands.\\u201d Complaint, Prayer for Relief, \\u00b6 1, at 14-15. 5.\\u2003Second, Jemez Pueblo asks the Court to \\u201c[e]nter a judgment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2409a quieting the aboriginal Indian title to the lands of the Valles Caldera National Preserve in Plaintiff.\\u201d Complaint, Prayer for Relief, \\u00b6 2, at 15. 6.\\u2003Third, Jemez Pueblo asks the Court to \\u201c[a]ward Jemez Pueblo its attorneys' fees, costs and expenses for this action.\\u201d Complaint, Prayer for Relief, \\u00b6 3, at 15. 2.\\u2003Judge Brack's Decision. 7.\\u2003On September 24, 2013, Judge Brack granted the United States' motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction by relying primarily on the Tenth Circuit's opinion in Navajo Tribe of Indians v. New Mexico, 809 F.2d 1455, 1463 (10th Cir. 1987), which held that the statute of limitations within the ICCA bars suits against the United States for aboriginal title claims. See Pueblo of Jemez I, 2013 WL 11325229, at *5 (citing Navajo Tribe of Indians v. New Mexico, 809 F.2d at 1463). 8.\\u2003Specifically, Judge Brack holds that Jemez Pueblo had a claim against the United States that accrued as a matter of law before 1946 and, therefore, that Jemez Pueblo's sole remedy is to have brought an action before the ICC before the statute of limitations bars the claim. See Pueblo of Jemez I, 2013 WL 11325229, at *4 (\\u201cIt is well-established that the ICCA provided the exclusive remedy for pre-1946 Indian tribal land claims against the United States\\u2024 In other words, if a Tribe failed to bring a timely claim under the ICCA, it lost its opportunity to litigate its dispute with the United States.\\u201d). 9.\\u2003Judge Brack further concludes that Jemez Pueblo did not distinguish its claim from contrary precedent and instead \\u201crelie[d] on inapplicable cases involving claims for aboriginal title against parties other than [the United States].\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez I, 2013 WL 11325229, at *4. 10.\\u2003Regarding the Tenth's Circuit opinion in Navajo Tribe of Indians v. New Mexico, Judge Brack stated that he is \\u201cnot free to speculate\\u201d about how broadly the Tenth Circuit interprets the word \\u201cclaim,\\u201d and instead is tasked with ascertaining and applying the Tenth Circuit's holding that the Tribe's claim against the United States is barred, because the claim falls within the ICCA's exclusive jurisdiction and is therefore subject to the ICCA's statute of limitations. Pueblo of Jemez I, 2013 WL 11325229, at *4. Judge Brack concluded that Navajo Tribe of Indians v. New Mexico is controlling precedent, and that Jemez Pueblo's inconsistent suggestions that it does not control and that the Tenth Circuit wrongly decided it are \\u201cboth unpersuasive and unavailing.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez I, 2013 WL 11325229, at *4. Moreover, Judge Brack found that Navajo Tribe of Indians v. New Mexico is \\u201cconcordant\\u201d with out-of-circuit precedent. Pueblo of Jemez I, 2013 WL 11325229, at *4. 11.\\u2003Judge Brack took issue with the fact that Jemez Pueblo asserts both that the Baca heirs received their 1860 land grant subject to Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title and also that Jemez Pueblo did not have a claim against the United States in 1946: Plaintiff cannot have it both ways. Either Defendant's grant to the Baca family extinguished aboriginal title or not. If the Baca land grant extinguished Plaintiff's aboriginal title, then aboriginal title was extinguished in 1860 and Plaintiff cannot claim aboriginal title now. On the other hand, if the Baca land grant did not extinguish Plaintiff's aboriginal title, Plaintiff's claim existed prior to 1946 and Plaintiff had the opportunity to avail itself of the remedy afforded by the ICCA and such claim is now barred by the statute of limitations contained in the ICCA. Pueblo of Jemez I, 2013 WL 11325229, at *4. 12.\\u2003Judge Brack also concludes that ICCA \\u00a7 22 required Jemez Pueblo to litigate its claim to the Valles Caldera in its prior ICC proceedings when it sought compensation, and received money damages, for the taking and extinguishment of aboriginal title to other Jemez Pueblo lands. See Pueblo of Jemez I, 2013 WL 11325229, at *5. Judge Brack therefore concludes further that, \\u201c[b]ecause [Jemez Pueblo] did not comply with the requirements of the ICCA with respect to the subject property, its claim against the United States is barred by sovereign immunity.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez I, 2013 WL 11325229, at *5. Moreover, Judge Brack states that the United States' relatively recent acquisition of the Valles Caldera has no effect on his analysis given that \\u201c[c]ourts have uniformly held that a tribe cannot obtain review of a historical land claim otherwise barred by the ICCA by challenging present-day actions involving the land.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez I, 2013 WL 11325229, at *5. 3.\\u2003The Tenth Circuit's Opinion. 13.\\u2003On June 26, 2015, the Tenth Circuit issued an opinion which concludes that Judge Brack erred in dismissing Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera claim. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1147. In doing so, the Tenth Circuit reiterates that, absent clear-and-unequivocal Congressional intent to extinguish pre-existing aboriginal rights, Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal right of occupancy survives the grant to the Baca heirs. See 790 F.3d at 1162-63. The Tenth Circuit further holds that the Baca heirs' occupation of the Valles Caldera, standing alone, may not be sufficient to extinguish aboriginal title, because fee title and aboriginal title can exist simultaneously. See 790 F.3d at 1165. Hence, the Tenth Circuit remands the case to Judge Brack for consideration whether Jemez Pueblo \\u201chad, and still has, aboriginal title to the land at issue in this case.\\u201d 790 F.3d at 1165. 14.\\u2003After providing a detailed history of aboriginal rights, the Tenth Circuit first turns to the question of subject-matter jurisdiction. See 790 F.3d at 1161. In describing its analysis whether Judge Brack has subject-matter jurisdiction, the Tenth Circuit notes that if Jemez Pueblo had a claim against the United States which, as a matter of law, accrued before August 13, 1946 \\u2024 then the district court was correct in holding the claim barred by ICCA \\u00a7 12 and concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction. If we cannot determine as a matter of law that there was a pre\\u20131946 claim against the government, then the claim is not facially barred by \\u00a7 12 of the ICCA. Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1161. Regardless the Tenth Circuit's claim-accrual analysis, the Tenth Circuit also tasked itself, in accordance with the United States' rule 12(b)(1) argument, to \\u201cdetermine alternatively whether compensation paid to the Jemez Pueblo in prior litigation before the ICC forecloses this claim under the ICCA \\u00a7 22.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1161. The Tenth Circuit then rejects the United States' position that the 1860 land grant and the Surveyor General's assessment that the lands were vacant extinguished Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title, concluding that \\u201c[t]he government's arguments ignore the nature of aboriginal title and the last 200 years of Supreme Court jurisprudence.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1162. The Tenth Circuit cites numerous Supreme Court and Courts of Appeals decisions which hold that federal land grants pass fee title to grantees subject to aboriginal title. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1162. For example, the Tenth Circuit quotes extensively from Oneida Indian Nation of New York State v. Oneida County, New York, wherein the Supreme Court held that \\u201cIndian title \\u2024 could be terminated only by sovereign act.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1162 (quoting Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y. State v. Oneida Cty., 414 U.S. at 667, 94 S.Ct. 772). Given this controlling precedent, the Tenth Circuit concludes that, because the United States could not show \\u201cclear and unambiguous intent by Congress to allow extinguishment of the aboriginal right of occupancy of the Jemez Pueblo \\u2024 the grant of land to the Baca heirs was valid to convey the fee but the Baca heirs took the title subject to the Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1161-62. 15.\\u2003The Tenth Circuit also rejects the United States' assertion that Jemez Pueblo's claim to \\u201cactual, exclusive, and continuous\\u201d use of the Valles Caldera is \\u201cflatly inconsistent\\u201d with the Surveyor General's finding that the land was \\u201cvacant,\\u201d because such an assertion \\u201cconflates the factual merits question of establishing aboriginal possession with the jurisdictional question on appeal of when a claim actually accrued.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1163. The Tenth Circuit cites the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Santa Fe Pacific Railroad Co., 314 U.S. 339, 62 S.Ct. 248, 86 L.Ed. 260 (1941)(\\u201cSanta Fe\\u201d), as evidence that the establishment of the office of Surveyor General did not institute a policy of non-recognition of aboriginal title, because the Surveyor General could only make recommendations to Congress, and it was left to Congress to decide what action to take. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1163-64 (citing Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 348, 62 S.Ct. 248). Thus, according to the Tenth Circuit, because the Surveyor General had no authority to extinguish aboriginal title, his belief as to vacancy of the lands is irrelevant. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1164. 16.\\u2003The United States' argument that the 1860 Act evidenced Congressional intent to effect \\u201cabsolute and unconditional\\u201d transfer not subject to preexisting interests also failed to persuade the Tenth Circuit, because, according to the Tenth Circuit, \\u201cthe [Supreme] Court has never held that a grant needs to contain specific language stating the land remains subject to aboriginal title.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1164. Instead, according to the Tenth Circuit, the Supreme Court has repeatedly concluded that \\u201clanguage [is] required in the grant to clearly show Congress's intent to extinguish aboriginal title.\\u201d 790 F.3d at 1164. The United States' argument fails, therefore, because the Tenth Circuit \\u201ccan discern no such language or intent in the 1860 Act.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1164. 17.\\u2003In addressing the United States' argument that the Baca heirs' use of the Valles Caldera is a cloud on title sufficient to trigger accrual against the United States in 1860, the Tenth Circuit counters that simultaneous occupancy and use of land pursuant to fee title, and aboriginal title, can occur, because the nature of Indian occupancy differs significantly from non-Indian settlers' occupancy. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165. The Tenth Circuit highlights such disparate use when it states that it is easy to see how the Surveyor General may have mistakenly believed the lands were vacant even if they were being used by the Jemez for hunting, fishing, and other such activities. Similarly, it is also easy to see how a peaceful and private Indian pueblo might have used portions of this large area of land for its traditional purposes while one agreeable rancher was using portions of it for grazing livestock. Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165. The Tenth Circuit notes that the Complaint makes such allegations and, therefore, the Tenth Circuit concludes that one cannot say that accrual necessarily occurred in 1860. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165. 18.\\u2003The Tenth Circuit notes, however, that, to establish on remand its right of aboriginal occupancy to the Valles Caldera \\u201cin 1860 and thereafter,\\u201d Jemez Pueblo \\u201cmust show \\u2018actual, exclusive, and continuous use and occupancy for a long time.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d 790 F.3d at 1165-66 (quoting Native Vill. of Eyak v. Blank, 688 F.3d 619, 622 (9th Cir. 2012)). Significantly, according to the Tenth Circuit, the test's \\u201cexclusive\\u201d prong is relevant only to the exclusion of other Indian groups and, thus, the Bacas' use does not, as the United States' contends, cloud this prong. Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166. As to the \\u201cactual and continuous use\\u201d requirement, the Tenth Circuit states that Jemez Pueblo must show, as it alleges in its Complaint, that the Jemez people have continued for hundreds of years to use the Valles Caldera for traditional purposes, including hunting, grazing of livestock, gathering of medicine and of food for subsistence, and the like. As the cases make clear, if there was actually substantial interference by others with these traditional uses before 1946, the Jemez Pueblo will not be able to establish aboriginal title. In that circumstance, moreover, the Pueblo would be barred by the ICCA statute of limitations for failing to bring a claim before the ICC. Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166. According to the Tenth Circuit, such a determination is necessarily a factual question. See 790 F.3d at 1166. 19.\\u2003The Tenth Circuit concludes that gradual taking by the United States can extinguish aboriginal title. See 790 F.3d at 1166 (citing United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1393 (\\u201cThe Court of Claims' decision in Pueblo of San Ildefonso \\u2024 is illustrative of a situation in which white settlement and use, authorized by the federal government \\u2024 brought about a pre-1946 claim against the United States for failure to protect aboriginal title.\\u201d)). The Tenth Circuit notes that, in the Zia I-IV litigation, Jemez Pueblo advanced a gradual taking theory when it \\u201casserted that the United States owed [the Pueblos of Jemez, Zia, and Santa Ana] compensation for having extinguished their aboriginal titles as a matter of fact over time by interfering with their native use and occupancy.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1167. In analyzing the Zia I-IV litigation, the Tenth Circuit agreed with the Court of Claims' finding that the creation of the Jemez Forest Reserve \\u201cand other conduct of the government sufficiently interfered with the pueblos' traditional ways of living so as to effect a taking of their aboriginal titles.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1168. The Tenth Circuit stated that it could not reach such a conclusion, however, with respect to the present litigation given that, [a]t this point in the current proceedings, neither party has had the opportunity to offer evidence about whether anyone has actually interfered with the Jemez Pueblo's traditional occupancy and uses of the land in question here, before or after 1946. In sum, on the present record, we cannot say that either the Baca grant or use of the land by the Baca heirs or their successors establish as a matter of law that the Jemez Pueblo had a pre-1946 claim against the government under the ICCA. 790 F.3d at 1168. 20.\\u2003The Tenth Circuit clarifies its holding in Navajo Tribe of Indians v. New Mexico by distinguishing the claim in that case from Jemez Pueblo's current claim in two respects, thereby rejecting the United States' assertion that the case is \\u201cdirectly on point.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1168. First, according to the Tenth Circuit, the claim in Navajo Tribe of Indians v. New Mexico was not one of aboriginal title but rather of title that two presidential Executive Orders granted; the President restricted the Executive Orders to conferring on Tribes only \\u201ctransitory, possessory rights.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1169. Second, according to the Tenth Circuit, the Navajo Tribe conceded that the President intended his Executive Orders to extinguish aboriginal title, whereas Jemez Pueblo contends that Congress never extinguished its title and that the United States has not established otherwise. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1169. The Tenth Circuit adds that, given that the taking in Navajo Tribe of Indians v. New Mexico occurred in 1911, at a time when the President's actions did not entitle the Navajo to compensation, the Navajo Tribe was on notice in 1946 that it had a claim based on the 1911 Orders. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1170. 21.\\u2003The Tenth Circuit next rejects the United States' ICCA \\u00a7 22 argument that the compensation which Jemez Pueblo received in the Zia I-IV litigation forecloses its claim to the Valles Caldera. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1170. The Tenth Circuit concludes that, because there is no evidence the Pueblo had a claim against the United States prior to 1946 with respect to the land involved in this action, we disagree with the government that the Jemez Pueblo could have brought its current claims before the ICC in the prior litigation. The government's res judicata argument fails because the Jemez Pueblo's current claim is a quiet title action to establish that its aboriginal title to different land has not been extinguished. 790 F.3d 1143 at 1171. 22.\\u2003As to the United States' alternative argument that Jemez Pueblo's Complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to establish aboriginal title, and should therefore be dismissed under rule 12(b)(6), the Tenth Circuit holds that the Complaint's description of Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use over the past 800 years \\u201cprovides sufficient detail to put the government on notice of its claim of aboriginal title.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1172. Moreover, the Tenth Circuit also rejects the United States' assertion that, to survive a rule 12(b)(6) motion, Jemez Pueblo needs to allege that it has \\u201cexercised the right to expel the Baca heirs or their successors-in-interest or that the Pueblo exercise[s] full dominion and control over the Baca Ranch.\\u201d 790 F.3d at 1172. Such a requirement is unnecessary, the Tenth Circuit holds, \\u201cso long as the Pueblo alleged that it was also using the land in traditional Indian ways,\\u201d which it does. 790 F.3d at 1172. 23.\\u2003Finally, the Tenth Circuit rejects the United States' contention that the Preservation Act extinguishes aboriginal title \\u201cas a matter of law,\\u201d because \\u201cnowhere in the Preservation Act did Congress say it intended to extinguish aboriginal title. Rather, \\u2024 one of the purposes of the Act was to preserve the cultural and historic value of the land \\u2024 while avoiding interference with \\u2018Native American religious and cultural sites.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1172 (quoting 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 698v-3(g)(2)(B)). Moreover, \\u201cthe warranty deed the government accepted from the Baca successors to create the Preserve specifically excepted from the warrants all prior \\u2018claims of and demands of any Indian nation, tribe, or pueblo.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d 790 F.3d at 1172 (quoting Brief of Appellant Pueblo of Jemez at 21, filed April 30, 2014 (Doc. 01019242516 on the Tenth Circuit's docket)). Nevertheless, the Tenth Circuit \\u201cleave[s] it to the district court to address \\u2024 in the first instance on remand\\u201d whether the National Defense Authorization Act of 2015, 128 Stat. 3292 (\\u201c2015 Act\\u201d), which designated the Valles Caldera as a unit of the National Park System, \\u201cundisputedly extinguished any aboriginal title,\\u201d as the United States' maintains. Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1173 n.21. 4.\\u2003The Oct. 25 MOO. 24.\\u2003In the Oct. 25 MOO, the Court denies Jemez Pueblo's request to exclude from trial evidence of Valles Caldera use after 1848 by other than Jemez Pueblo, because the Court concludes that the Tenth Circuit expressly instructed the Court to consider such evidence. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 1-2, 350 F. Supp. 3d 1052, 1056-57 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165 (\\u201cWhether the Jemez Pueblo can establish that it exercised its right of aboriginal occupancy to these lands in 1860 and thereafter is a fact question to be established on remand, where it will have the opportunity to present evidence to support its claim.\\u201d)). 25.\\u2003The Court notes that, specifically, the Tenth Circuit instructed the Court to consider evidence necessary to determine whether Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use was exclusive as to other Indian Tribes. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 2, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1057 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165 (\\u201c[T]he \\u2018exclusive\\u2019 part of the test mean[s] \\u2024 that in order to establish aboriginal title, a tribe must show that it used and occupied the land to the exclusion of other Indian groups.\\u201d (emphasis in original))). 26.\\u2003The Tenth Circuit also instructed the Court to consider whether Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use suffered interference by others after Congress granted the land to the Baca heirs in 1860. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 2, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1057 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166 (\\u201c[I]f there was actually substantial interference by others with these traditional uses before 1946, the Jemez Pueblo will not be able to establish aboriginal title.\\u201d)). 27.\\u2003The Court also concludes that, because the expert report that Kehoe authored contains relevant evidence of multiple Pueblos' Valles Caldera use, the Court will not exclude the report's substance. See Oct 25 MOO at 2-3, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1057 (citing Expert Report of Dr. Terence Kehoe at 19-20, filed August 31, 2018 (Doc. 249-1)). 5.\\u2003The Nov. 15 MOO. 28.\\u2003In the Nov. 15 MOO, the Court concludes that the Federal Rules of Evidence do not permit the Court to admit out-of-court statements in American Indian oral tradition evidence when offered for the truth of the matter asserted, because the rule against hearsay prohibits such statements. See Nov. 15 MOO at 2, 366 F. Supp. 3d at 1237 (citing Fed. R. Evid. 802 (\\u201cHearsay is not admissible unless any of the following provides otherwise: a federal statute; these rules; or other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court.\\u201d)). 29.\\u2003The Court concludes that it may admit oral tradition evidence for non-hearsay purposes, if Jemez Pueblo can establish a non-hearsay purpose, such as background, for why Jemez Pueblo members believe things, do things, draw, or paint things, and that it also will admit hearsay statements in oral tradition evidence for the truth of the matter asserted pursuant to the hearsay exceptions enumerated in rule 803 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, provided such statements conform to the limited scope of each exception, as the Federal Rules of Evidence define the exception. See Nov. 15 MOO at 2, 366 F. Supp. 3d at 1238-39 (citing Fed. R. Evid. 803). 30.\\u2003The Court concludes that it will not admit, however, hearsay in oral tradition evidence pursuant to rule 807 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, the residual exception to the rule against hearsay, because the Court concludes that oral tradition evidence is not sufficiently exceptional to warrant admission pursuant to this rule. See Nov. 15 MOO at 2, 366 F. Supp. 3d at 1239 (citing Conoco Inc. v. Dep't of Energy, 99 F.3d 387, 392 (Fed. Cir. 1996)(concluding that the residual hearsay exception is \\u201cmeant to be reserved for exceptional cases,\\u201d and is \\u201cnot intended to confer \\u2018a broad license\\u2019 on trial judges \\u2018to admit hearsay statements that do not fall within one of the other exceptions contained in rules 803 and 804(b)\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d (quoting S. Rep. No. 94-199, at 20 (1975)))). 6.\\u2003The Court View Order. In the Court View Order, the Court grants in part and denies in part Jemez Pueblo's request that the Court conduct a one-day site visit to the Valles Caldera to see first-hand the land at issue. See Court View Order at 1-2 (citing Plaintiff Pueblo of Jemez's Motion and Memorandum in Support of Motion for Court View of Valles Caldera, filed August 7, 2018 (Doc. 225)). 7.\\u2003The Expert Witness Order. 31.\\u2003In the Expert Witness Order, the Court concludes that Jemez Pueblo may elicit from Ferguson opinion testimony at trial that relies on information from Jemez Pueblo member Frank Fragua, despite Jemez Pueblo not disclosing Fragua to the United States, because the four factors that the Tenth Circuit advises district courts to consider in Woodworker's Supply, Inc. v. Principal Mutual Life Insurance Co., 170 F.3d 985 (10th Cir. 1999)(\\u201cWoodworker's\\u201d), suggest that Jemez Pueblo's failure to identify Fragua is both justified and harmless, and because the Court will permit the United States to depose Fragua and thereby cure any potential prejudice. See Expert Witness Order at 2-3 (citing Woodworker's, 170 F.3d at 993 (\\u201cThe determination of whether a Rule 26(a) violation is justified or harmless is entrusted to the broad discretion of the district court.\\u201d)). 32.\\u2003Regarding Woodworker's four factors as applied to Ferguson's testimony, the Court concludes: First, Jemez Pueblo did not direct Dr. Ferguson to interview Fragua, see [Draft Transcript of Hearing\\u2009] at 35:24-36:10 [\\u2009(taken Oct. 11, 2018)(\\u201cOct. 11 Tr.\\u201d)\\u2009](Barnhouse), and both Jemez Pueblo and the United States became aware of Fragua only upon receipt of Dr. Ferguson's expert report on March 22, 2018, see [United States' Motion in Limine, filed August 17, 2018 (Doc. 230); United States' Motion in Limine, filed August 21, 2018 (Doc. 239)] at 9; [Oct. 11] Tr. at 36:8-15 (Barnhouse, Court). Both parties thus bore equally any resulting surprise. Second, the Court is giving the United States the opportunity to depose Fragua, which will cure any potential prejudice. Third, Fragua provided information regarding [Redacted]; however, [Redacted]; hence, much of, if not all of, the testimony derived from the Fragua interview would be cumulative at trial and thus not disruptive, see [Oct. 11] Tr. at 38:25-39-5 (Barnhouse, Court). Finally, Jemez Pueblo's failure to disclose Fragua was neither willful nor in bad faith. Expert Witness Order at 3. 33.\\u2003The Court next concludes that Jemez Pueblo may elicit from Liebmann opinion testimony at trial that relies on Roney's analysis of a portion of the Valles Caldera's ceramics collection, which the United States first discovered during Liebmann's deposition, because the Court concludes that Woodworker's four factors likewise advise against excluding the portions of Liebmann's testimony that rely on Roney's analysis and summarized findings, and because the Court will permit the United States to identify Roney's knowledge and methods before trial through deposition. See Expert Witness Order at 3-4 (citing Woodworker's, 170 F.3d at 993). 34.\\u2003Regarding Woodworker's four factors as applied to Liebmann's testimony, the Court concludes: First, Roney's assistance to Dr. Liebmann did not surprise the United States, because the United States provided dates for Roney to inspect ceramics at the Valles Caldera. See [Oct. 11] Tr. at 51:14-24 (Court, Leonard). Second, the Court will permit the United States to depose Roney regarding his credibility, principles, and methodology, and thereby cure any potential prejudice. See [Oct. 11] Tr. at 63:13-14 (Court). Third, permitting the portions of Dr. Liebmann's testimony that rely on Roney's findings will not disrupt the trial, because such reliance goes to the weight of Dr. Liebmann's testimony, which the United States can challenge on cross examination. Fourth, neither party has alleged any bad faith or willfulness. Expert Witness Order at 4. 8.\\u2003The SJ Order. 35.\\u2003In the SJ Order, the Court denies the United States' motions for summary judgment. See SJ Order at 2. The Court first concludes that whether other Tribes used the Valles Caldera does not per se defeat Jemez Pueblo's claim to aboriginal title over that land and that genuine issues of material fact remain regarding the extent of other Tribes' Valles Caldera use. See SJ Order at 2. The Court notes that, although the Tenth Circuit in this case stated that, to establish aboriginal title, a Tribe \\u201cmust show that it used and occupied the land to the exclusion of other Indian groups,\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165-66 (emphasis in original)(internal quotation marks omitted), the exclusive-use-and-occupancy rule is subject to exceptions for joint-and-amicable use, dominant use, and permissive use, see Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Tex. v. United States, No. 3-83, 2000 WL 1013532, at *12 (Fed. Cl. June 19, 2000). The Court concludes, therefore, that evidence of other Pueblos' Valles Caldera use will not necessarily defeat Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim. 36.\\u2003The Court notes that Jemez Pueblo asserts that its \\u201cuse of the Valles Caldera was dominant,\\u201d and that \\u201cany conflicting aboriginal title claims \\u2024 were extinguished when Jemez Pueblo entered the area or have been abandoned,\\u201d and concludes that Jemez Pueblo could maintain its aboriginal title claim through evidence that supports such assertions. SJ Order at 3 (citing Plaintiff Pueblo of Jemez's Response in Opposition to Defendant United States' Motion on the Pleadings and for Summary Judgment at 19-20, filed August 31, 2018 (Doc. 250)(\\u201cSJ Response\\u201d)). Moreover, given the Tenth Circuit's mandate that Jemez Pueblo \\u201cwill have the opportunity to present evidence to support its claim\\u201d that \\u201cit exercised its right of aboriginal occupancy to [the Valles Caldera] in 1860 and thereafter,\\u201d the Court will permit Jemez Pueblo to present and challenge evidence regarding when, where, and how often other Tribes' Valles Caldera use occurred. SJ Order at 3 (quoting Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165). 37.\\u2003The Court concludes that Jemez Pueblo's admission that third-party owners interfered with its Valles Caldera use does not defeat Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim. See SJ Order at 3. The Court notes that, although the Tenth Circuit has directed the Court to determine whether there was \\u201cactually substantial interference by others\\u201d with Jemez Pueblo's traditional uses of the Valles Caldera, Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166, and mentions that substantial interference could result from \\u201cwhite settlement and use, authorized by the federal government both statutorily and in fact,\\u201d 790 F.3d at 1166 (citing United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d 1383, 1393 (Ct. Cl. 1975)), controlling Supreme Court of the United States of America precedent compels the Court to interpret the Tenth Circuit's statement to indicate that aboriginal title extinguishment could result only from Congressionally authorized interference with Jemez Pueblo's traditional Valles Caldera use, see SJ Order at 4 (citing Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 347, 62 S.Ct. 248 (1941)(\\u201cExtinguishment of Indian title based on aboriginal possession is of course a different matter. The power of Congress in that regard is supreme.\\u201d); Cty. of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation, 470 U.S. 226, 247-48, 105 S.Ct. 1245, 84 L.Ed.2d 169 (1985)(\\u201c[C]ongressional intent to extinguish Indian title must be \\u2018plain and unambiguous,\\u2019 and will not be \\u2018lightly implied.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d (quoting Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 346, 354, 62 S.Ct. 248))). 38.\\u2003Based on the Tenth Circuit's mandate to consider evidence of \\u201csubstantial interference by others,\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166, the Court identifies five factors, none of which by itself is dispositive, that could support a finding that non-Indians substantially interfered with aboriginal title over time so as to effectuate a gradual taking absent express Congressional intent: (i) the creation of an Indian reservation; (ii) Congressionally authorized non-Indian settlement of historic Tribal lands; (iii) a Congressionally ratified Executive Order increasing the size of reservation lands set aside for exclusive Indian use; (iv) a cabinet-level order, pursuant to a Congressional act, imposing restrictions on Indian use of their historic lands; and (v) Congressional or executive action designating Tribal land for conservation, recreation, or commercial use, such as a forest reserve, grazing district, or the like, see SJ Order at 4-5 (citing United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1386-90; Gila River Pima-Maricopa Indian Cmty. v. United States, 494 F.2d 1386, 1391-93 (Ct. Cl. 1974)). 39.\\u2003The Court notes that each of the above factors, which the Court derived from the cases that the Tenth Circuit cited in Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, involves some Congressional action, either directly or through the President, that significantly affects an Indian Tribe's use of its historic lands. See SJ Order at 5.\\u2003In this way, the Court of Claims never completely abrogated the need for Congressional intent to extinguish aboriginal title, but rather found that Congressional intent was implied based on various actions offensive to aboriginal use and possession. See SJ Order at 5. 40.\\u2003The Court concludes that, because neither party in this case has suggested that Congress has expressly extinguished aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera, the Court will permit both parties to present evidence to support or refute the five above-mentioned factors, each of which support the Tenth Circuit's mandate to consider evidence of \\u201csubstantial interference by others\\u201d with Jemez Pueblo's traditional Valles Caldera use. Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166. SJ Order at 5. 41.\\u2003The Court concludes that no statutes of limitations bar Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim. See SJ Order at 5. In addressing the United States' argument that the Baca heirs' Valles Caldera use is a cloud on title sufficient to trigger accrual against the United States in 1860, the Court directs the parties to the Tenth Circuit's statement that \\u201csimultaneous occupancy and use of land pursuant to fee title, and aboriginal title, can occur, because the nature of Indian occupancy differs significantly from non-Indian settlers' occupancy.\\u201d SJ Order at 6 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165). The Court emphasizes that the Tenth Circuit expressly permits such disparate use when it states that \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018it is \\u2024 easy to see how a peaceful and private Indian pueblo might have used portions of this large area of land for its traditional purposes while one agreeable rancher was using portions of it for grazing livestock.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d SJ Order at 6 (quoting Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165). 42.\\u2003The Court states that, because Jemez Pueblo argues that Jemez people \\u201calive during both periods of Bond and Dunigan ownership\\u201d continued to access the Valles Caldera for traditional purposes, to include hunting game, taking eagles, and conducting religious pilgrimages to Redondo Peak, SJ Order at 6 (quoting Response at 22-23), and that \\u201cits claim accrued only when the United States acquired an interest in the Valles Caldera in 2000 and began limiting the Jemez Pueblo's access to the land in a manner inconsistent with its aboriginal title,\\u201d SJ Order at 6 (quoting Response at 27 (quoting Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1152)), the Court is not convinced that, as a matter of law, a taking occurred between 1860 and 2000, and, therefore, will not bar Jemez Pueblo's claim based on the United States' theory that the statute of limitations accrued, see SJ Order at 6. 43.\\u2003The Court concludes that Santa Clara Pueblo is not a necessary and indispensable party such that the Court must dismiss the case pursuant to rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See SJ Order at 6. The Court quotes Jemez Pueblo's assertion that it \\u201cdoes not make any claim to the land transferred by the Dunigans to Santa Clara Pueblo, or the reciprocal easement transferred by the Dunigans directly to Santa Clara Pueblo,\\u201d SJ Order at 6 (citing Response at 33), and concludes that Santa Clara Pueblo's absence does not prevent Jemez Pueblo from receiving its requested relief against the United States, see SJ Order at 6. The Court further concludes that the Indian lands exception to the QTA precludes the Court from entering judgment that would affect Santa Clara Pueblo's easement. See SJ Order at 6-7 (citing Block v. North Dakota ex rel. Bd. of Univ. and Sch. Lands, 461 U.S. 273, 287, 103 S.Ct. 1811, 75 L.Ed.2d 840 (1983)(\\u201cBlock v. North Dakota\\u201d)(affirming that, pursuant to the QTA, the United States does not waive sovereign immunity where the land either is held in \\u201ctrust or [is] restricted Indian lands\\u201d)). 44.\\u2003The Court expresses its confidence in the United States' ability to robustly defend against Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim, and thereby defend Santa Clara Pueblo's interests in the United States' continued stewardship of the Valles Caldera. See SJ Order at 7. 45.\\u2003The Court concludes that the doctrine of laches\\u2009 does not bar Jemez Pueblo's claims pursuant to the QTA, which provides for a twelve-year statute of limitations, because Congress enacted a statute of limitations in the QTA, and because Jemez Pueblo brought its claims within the statutorily prescribed limitations period. See SJ Order at 7 (citing United States v. Rodriguez-Aguirre, 264 F.3d 1195, 1208 (10th Cir. 2001)(\\u201cWhen a limitation on the period for bringing suit has been set by statute, laches will generally not be invoked to shorten the statutory period.\\u201d)). 46.\\u2003The Court further concludes that the period between 2000 and when Jemez Pueblo filed its Complaint does not represent the \\u201clongstanding observances and settled expectations\\u201d at issue in City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York, 544 U.S. 197, 125 S.Ct. 1478, 161 L.Ed.2d 386 (2005), wherein the Supreme Court noted that \\u201c[i]t has been two centuries since the Oneidas last exercised regulatory control over the properties,\\u201d and thereafter applied laches to bar the Oneida's claim that its land purchases unified the land's fee and aboriginal title such that the Oneidas could assert sovereign authority over the recently reacquired property. SJ Order at 8 (quoting City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York, 544 U.S. at 200, 125 S.Ct. 1478 (internal quotation marks omitted)). 9.\\u2003The Partial SJ Order. 47.\\u2003In the Partial SJ Order, Court first concludes that genuine issues of material fact remain regarding the extent of other Tribes' Banco Bonito use and, therefore, declines to enter partial summary judgment in Jemez Pueblo's favor as to the Banco Bonito. See Partial SJ Order at 2. The Court notes that, to establish its right to the Banco Bonito, Jemez Pueblo must show \\u201cactual, exclusive, and continuous use and occupancy for a long time.\\u201d Partial SJ Order at 2 (quoting Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165 (internal quotation marks omitted)(quoting Sac & Fox Tribe of Indians of Okl. v. United States, 383 F.2d 991, 998-99 (Ct. Cl. 1967))). Although Jemez Pueblo asserts that its Banco Bonito use \\u201cwas exclusive,\\u201d in part, because \\u201c[t]here was no archeological evidence that any other tribe used and occupied Banco Bonito,\\u201d which, according to Jemez Pueblo, indicates that \\u201cJemez controlled the area as to any other tribes,\\u201d the Court notes that dispute remains regarding whether the Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana, and Zia jointly used the Banco Bonito, which, if true, could defeat Jemez Pueblo's claim to exclusive use. See Partial SJ Order at 2 (quoting Plaintiff Pueblo of Jemez's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Confirming Its Indian (Aboriginal) Title to the Banco Bonito and Redondo Mountain, filed August 17, 2018 (Doc. 237); Plaintiff Pueblo of Jemez's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment Confirming Its Indian (Aboriginal) Title to the Banco Bonito and Redondo Mountain at 22, filed August 17, 2018 (Doc. 238)(collectively the \\u201cPartial SJ Motion\\u201d)). 48.\\u2003The Court also concludes that genuine issues of material fact remain regarding the extent of other Tribes' Redondo Peak use, and so the Court cannot enter properly partial summary judgment in Jemez Pueblo's favor as to that land. See Partial SJ Order at 2. Although Jemez Pueblo asserts that its Redondo Mountain use \\u201cis exclusive because, even if other tribes historically used Redondo, which is disputed, it is undisputed that other tribes have not used Redondo Mountain in at least the past eighteen years or, to the extent there may be other minimal use by a tribe, Jemez's uses were dominant,\\u201d Partial SJ Motion at 24; the Court notes that both Santa Clara Pueblo and the Zia Pueblo have stated that they hold Redondo Mountain sacred, and continue to use it for traditional purposes without concern for Jemez Pueblo's use, which, if true, could defeat Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim, see Partial SJ Order at 3. The Court quotes from the portion of the September 14, 2018, hearing wherein the Court notes that \\u201cagents of Jemez \\u2024 at one time or another, seemed to indicate that other people were using [Redondo] mountain.\\u201d Transcript of Hearing at 65:5-8 (taken September 14, 2018), filed September 21, 2018 (Doc. 278)(Court). Although other Tribes' Redondo Mountain use does not per se defeat Jemez Pueblo's claim to aboriginal title over that land, the Court concludes that it cannot as a matter of law grant Jemez Pueblo's motion for partial summary judgment. See Partial SJ Order at 3. 10.\\u2003The Bench Trial. 49.\\u2003The Court held a bench trial on October 29-November 20, 2018; November 29 November 30, 2018; December 3, 2018; December 5, 2018; and December 13, 2018. See Bench Trial Minutes at 1-3. 50.\\u2003At trial, Jemez Pueblo presented the testimony of four expert witnesses and fourteen fact witnesses through live testimony. See Bench Trial Minutes at 4-45. 51.\\u2003The United States presented the testimony of four expert witnesses and nine fact witnesses through live testimony. See Bench Trial Minutes at 4-45. 52.\\u2003The parties also entered into evidence twelve witnesses' testimony through deposition designations, subject to objections raised to the exhibits containing the designated portions of the deposition transcripts. See Bench Trial Minutes at 8, 37, 43, 44. 53.\\u2003Neither party challenged any expert's qualifications to offer opinion testimony. See Bench Trial Minutes at 4-45. 11.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo's Post Trial Brief. 54.\\u2003In its post-trial brief, Jemez Pueblo first argues that, in accord with controlling Supreme Court and Tenth Circuit precedent, it presented facts which confirm that Jemez Pueblo possesses unextinguished aboriginal title to the entire Valles Caldera. See Plaintiff Pueblo of Jemez's Closing Brief at 1, filed May 6, 2019 (Doc. 391)(\\u201cJemez Pueblo's Br.\\u201d). In contrast, asserts Jemez Pueblo, the United States asks the Court to disregard precedent, controlling law, and the evidentiary record to reach the opposite conclusion. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 1. 55.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that judicial estoppel precludes the United States' argument that Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera is extinguished. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 2. According to Jemez Pueblo, in New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968 (2001), an unanimous Supreme Court concludes that judicial estoppel is available against a sovereign and identifies factors that courts should consider in determining whether to apply the doctrine. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 2 (citing New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. at 743, 121 S.Ct. 1808). Jemez Pueblo directs the Court to several out-of-circuit cases that, according to Jemez Pueblo, conclude that courts may apply judicial estoppel regardless whether the United States is a party, because governments are duty-bound to deal honestly with their citizens and because the judiciary has an independent duty to preserve the law's integrity. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 4-5 (citing Reid v. United States INS, 949 F.2d 287, 288 (9th Cir. 1991); United States v. Owens, 54 F.3d 271, 275 (6th Cir. 1995); Reynolds v. Comm'r. of Internal Rev., 861 F.2d 469 (6th Cir. 1988); Brandt v. Hickel, 427 F.2d 53, 57 (9th Cir. 1970)); (\\u201cTo say to these appellants, \\u2018The joke is on you. You shouldn't have trusted us,\\u2019 is hardly worthy of our great government.\\u201d); Menges v. Dentler, 33 Pa. 495, 500 (1859)(\\u201cMen naturally trust in their government, and ought to do so, and they ought not to suffer for it.\\u201d). 56.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that the Court should estop the United States from arguing that Jemez Pueblo does not have aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera, because, in United States ex rel. Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana & Zia v. Abousleman, the United States asserts, according to Jemez Pueblo, that Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title to water rights is unextinguished, and aboriginal title to water necessarily includes aboriginal title to land. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 5-6 (citing United States' Proposed Conclusions of Law \\u00b6\\u00b6 44-54, at 10-12, filed April 15, 2019 (Doc. 385)). Another reason that the Court should apply the estoppel doctrine, argues Jemez Pueblo, is because, in this case, the United States advocates for a substantial-interference extinguishment standard, but, in other, pending litigation, the United States has argued for the clear-and-unambiguous-act-of-Congress standard. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 6-7. 57.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that the United States' positions in this case and in United States ex rel. Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana & Zia v. Abousleman create the perception that the United States has misled either the Court or the Honorable Martha V\\u00e1zquez, United States District Judge for the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, and that such a perception is a factor that courts should consider in determining whether to apply judicial estoppel. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 12-14 (citing New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. at 751, 121 S.Ct. 1808; Bradford v. Wiggins, 516 F.3d 1189, 1194 (10th Cir. 2008)). Jemez Pueblo adds that the United States' positions give the United States an unfair advantage over and impose an unfair detriment on Jemez Pueblo, which also counsels in estoppel's favor. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 14-16 (citing New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. at 751, 121 S.Ct. 1808). 58.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that a further factor which the Court should consider in weighing whether to impose estoppel is that, by taking inconsistent positions in litigation involving Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal rights, the United States violates its fiduciary obligations to defend Jemez Pueblo's interests as a trustee. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 16-17 (citing Ann C. Juliano, Conflicted Justice: The Department of Justice's Conflict of Interest in Representing Native American Tribes, 37 Ga. L. Rev. 1307 (2003)). 59.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that it has met its burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it established aboriginal Indian title to the Valles Caldera, in part, because Jemez Pueblo members testified to actual Valles Caldera use, and because its expert witnesses, such as Ferguson, Garc\\u00eda y Griego, and Liebmann, testified that such use has occurred for a long time, which Anschuetz conceded, according to Jemez Pueblo. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 18 (citing Jemez Pueblo's Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 166-74, 286-310, 350-53, 355-82, 385-89, 397, 401, 411-14, 437-40, at 66-70, 103-08, 118-28, 130, 133-34, 139-40.). Moreover, according to Jemez Pueblo, fourteen other Pueblos and Tribes, and four Tribal organizations, confirmed that Jemez Pueblo has a reputation in the American Indian community as the Valles Caldera's aboriginal owner. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 18-19. 60.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo asserts that it drove other Tribes from the Valles Caldera when its ancestors migrated to the area and that, ever since, it has dominated and defended those lands, including from multiple Navajo Nation attacks.

See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 20 (citing Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 353-54, 62 S.Ct. 248; Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1170; Oct 25 MOO at 114, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1052, 1116 n.37), and instead relitigates arguments that the Tenth Circuit rejected on appeal, specifically that Jemez Pueblo's decision not to bring its Valles Caldera claim before the ICC bars Jemez Pueblo from bringing that claim here, see Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 20-21 (citing United States' Proposed Conclusions \\u00b6\\u00b6 114-115, at 28) (\\u201cThis Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because Plaintiff's claims are jurisdictionally barred by Section 22 of the Indian Claims Commission Act.\\u201d), and that the 1860 Baca Grant, or Surveyor General's underlying findings, could extinguish Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal Indian title, but ignores direct rulings rejecting this argument, see Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 20-21 (citing United States' Proposed Conclusions \\u00b6\\u00b6 44-54, at 10). 64.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that the United States' Proposed Conclusions ignore established law and the controlling law of the case, and instead ask the Court to create its own legal standards. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 22 (citing United States v. Graham, 704 F.3d 1275, 1278 (10th Cir. 2013)(\\u201cUnder the \\u2018law of the case\\u2019 doctrine, when a court rules on an issue of law, the ruling \\u2018should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d) (quoting Arizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 618, 103 S.Ct. 1382, 75 L.Ed.2d 318 (1983))). The United States evidences such disregard, according to Jemez Pueblo, when it asserts \\u201cthat \\u2018the only interest created by aboriginal Indian title is a permissive right of occupancy subject to the will of the sovereign and valid only against third parties,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 24 (quoting United States' Proposed Conclusions \\u00b6 9, at 2), which Jemez Pueblo argues not only ignores the Tenth Circuit's ruling, but also radically reinterprets controlling law that: (i) aboriginal Indian title predates any title to which the United States may assert; (ii) the United States can extinguish aboriginal title only through clear-and-unambiguous Congressional action; and (iii) the Tenth Circuit has confirmed Jemez Pueblo's right to bring this action against the United States, see Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 24. Jemez Pueblo adds that no court has agreed with the United States' assertion that aboriginal title is meaningless unless the United States chooses to recognize it. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 24 (citing United States' Proposed Conclusions \\u00b6 8, at 2 (\\u201cUnless otherwise specified by an act of Congress, aboriginal rights prevail only against parties other than the United States.\\u201d); id. \\u00b6 9, at 2 (\\u201c[U]nrecognized aboriginal title alone does not confer upon Jemez Pueblo any authority to accomplish that which it seeks through this lawsuit\\u2024\\u201d). According to Jemez Pueblo, the United States is asking the Court to ignore precedent which recognizes that aboriginal title preexists and, therefore, does not require the United States' recognition. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 25-26. 65.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that the United States has not proposed a finding of fact which asserts that the Baca heirs or successors took any action that actually and substantially interfered with Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use, and was connected to a Congressional act intended to extinguish Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera, and instead asserts merely that, during the time period before 1946, Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use changed, because the Valles Caldera's private owners charged Jemez Pueblo to graze livestock, see Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 27-28 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6 105, at 29), and required Jemez Pueblo members to ask permission to use the lands for traditional purposes, see Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 27-28 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6 106, at 28). The United States neither argues, according to Jemez Pueblo, that such conditions resulted in Jemez Pueblo using the Valles Caldera less nor identifies a specific date on which it alleges that these restrictions extinguished Jemez Pueblo's title, nor what possible Congressional act could \\u201cserve as the \\u2018plain and unambiguous [congressional] action\\u2019 required to extinguish aboriginal Indian title.\\u201d Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 28 (quoting Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 346, 62 S.Ct. 248; Oneida Cty. v.

Hence, Jemez Pueblo concludes, without \\u201csubstantial interference,\\u201d the Court cannot determine that Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera claim accrued before the ICCA statute of limitations period expired. Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 29. 66.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo reminds the Court that the Court has already concluded that \\u201cthe ICC cases \\u2018do not provide sufficient precedential value to control the Court in this case\\u2019 \\u2024 and \\u2018are merely persuasive authority, and \\u2024 are not very persuasive, because the issue \\u2024 whether a taking occurred was neither contested nor adjudicated in the Court of Claims' opinions.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 29 (quoting Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 119 n.39, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1119 n.39). Jemez Pueblo adds that the ICC lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate claims involving unextinguished aboriginal title. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 29 (citing ICCA, 60 Stat. 1049, \\u00a7 2). Jemez Pueblo then asserts that the conflict of interest between the United States and claims attorneys, who filed stipulations that transformed Tribes' damages claims into fictitious takings claims to obtain ICC awards for fictitious takings, resulted in caselaw that disregards Supreme Court precedent. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 30-31 (citing Pueblo of Santo Domingo v. United States, 647 F.2d 1087, 1090-91 (Ct. Cl. 1981)(Nichols, J., dissenting); Gila River Pima-Maricopa Indian Cmty., 494 F.2d at 1394 (Nichols, J., concurring)). 67.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that the United States ignores that the Valles Caldera was not at issue before the ICC in either Jemez Pueblo's joint action with Santa Ana Pueblo and Zia Pueblo, or in Santa Clara Pueblo's, San Ildefonso Pueblo's, and Jicarilla Apache Tribe's actions, and, therefore, the ICC did not make any conclusions regarding the Valles Caldera, which suggests, according to Jemez Pueblo, that the United States' argument that other Pueblos' ICC litigation precludes Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera claim is inapposite. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 32-34. 68.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that the statute of limitations within the Indian Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1505, does not bar Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera claim, because \\u201c[n]othing happened between 1946 and 2000 that triggered the running of that statute of limitations,\\u201d and \\u201c[t]he Tenth Circuit has already denied the Government's parallel argument with regard to ICCA Section 22.\\u201d Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 34 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1171). 69.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that the Tenth Circuit has already rejected the United States' argument that the 1860 land grant to the Baca heirs extinguished Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera, see Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 35 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1164-65 (\\u201c[T]he Baca heirs were granted fee title subject to any pre-existing aboriginal occupancy rights of the Jemez Pueblo.\\u201d)), and that, as a matter of law, the grant contains no language that purports to extinguish aboriginal title, see Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 35 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1170 (\\u201c[A]boriginal title cannot be extinguished by the grant to a third party of fee title to the land at issue except by clear and unambiguous congressional intent.\\u201d)). The Tenth Circuit similarly concluded, according to Jemez Pueblo, that the Surveyor General of New Mexico had no authority to extinguish aboriginal title, see Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 35 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1163 (\\u201c[T]he conclusion of the Surveyor General of New Mexico that the lands at issue were vacant and thus could be transferred to the Baca heirs did not by itself serve to extinguish existing aboriginal title.\\u201d); id. at 1164 (\\u201cIt therefore makes no difference that the Surveyor General believed the land selected by the Baca heirs was vacant. He had no authority to extinguish the Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title.\\u201d)). 70.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that, notwithstanding the United States' assertions to the contrary, the Tenth Circuit has already concluded that Jemez Pueblo can succeed in its aboriginal title claim without proving that the Baca heirs and their successors were not actively using the Valles Caldera, see Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 36 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1172), because, according to Jemez Pueblo, aboriginal title's exclusivity prong permits non-Indian occupancy and use given that such use differs significantly from Indian occupancy and use for traditional purposes, see Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 37-38 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165; Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 47, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1080). 71.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo asserts that the Court has already rejected the United States' argument that, because Santa Clara Pueblo is an indispensable party, the Court should dismiss Jemez Pueblo's action pursuant to rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 38 (citing SJ Order at 6-7). Jemez Pueblo adds that the United States at trial called numerous American Indian witnesses from Pueblos other than Jemez Pueblo, including Santa Clara Pueblo, and thereby affirmed the Court's prediction that \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018the United States will robustly defend against Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim, and thereby defend the Pueblo of Santa Clara's interest in the United States' continued stewardship of the Valles Caldera.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 39-40 (quoting SJ Order at 7). 72.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo asserts that the Court has already rejected the United States' argument that the doctrine of laches bars Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera claim, see Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 39-40 (citing SJ Order at 7 (\\u201c[B]ecause Congress enacted a statute of limitations in the Quiet Title Act, because Jemez Pueblo brought this action pursuant to the statutory authority granted in the Quiet Title Act, and because Jemez Pueblo did so within the statutorily prescribed limitations period, this Court declines to apply laches to bar Jemez Pueblo's claim to the Valles Caldera.\\u201d)), and adds that the United States cites no facts which evidence \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018longstanding observances and settled expectations\\u2019 that arose prior to 2000 sufficient to require the Court to revisit the issue,\\u201d Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 39-40 (quoting United States' Proposed Conclusions \\u00b6 132, at 32 n.9). 73.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that, because the Tenth Circuit has already resolved that the Indian canon of construction, which, according to Jemez Pueblo, states that, \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018if there is doubt whether aboriginal title has been validly extinguished by the United States, any doubtful expressions, instead of being resolved in favor of the United States, are to be resolved in favor of the Indians,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d applies to Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera claim, the Court should not consider the United States' argument that, because Tribal interests in the Valles Caldera are aligned against Jemez Pueblo, the Court should disregard the canon. Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 40-41 (quoting Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1162). Jemez Pueblo further argues that Tribal interests are not aligned, because the Tribal witnesses who testified to personal Valles Caldera use lacked official Tribal council resolutions authorizing such witnesses to testify on their respective Tribe's behalf. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 41-42. Jemez Pueblo adds that the Court need apply the Indian canon only when ambiguity exists, and that aboriginal title extinguishment is not ambiguous, because the Supreme Court, the Tenth Circuit, and the Court have confirmed that extinguishment cannot occur absent plain and unambiguous Congressional intent. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 42-43 (citing Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 353-54, 62 S.Ct. 248; Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 119 n.39, 350 F.

Supp. 3d at 1059). 75.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that the United States ignores the aboriginal title law doctrine which states that \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018exclusive\\u2019 use applies only to \\u2018exclusion of other Indian groups\\u2019 and does not include use by non-Indians,\\u201d Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 44-45 (quoting Jemez Pueblo's Proposed Conclusions \\u00b6\\u00b6 41, at 25-26)(emphasis in Jemez Pueblo's Br.), when the United States instead asserts, according to Jemez Pueblo, \\u201cthat \\u2018exclusive\\u2019 applies to all \\u2018adverse claimants\\u2019 and \\u2018not just adverse Indians\\u2019 and again, asks this Court to adopt irrelevant facts into this incorrect legal standard,\\u201d Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 45 (quoting United States' Proposed Conclusions \\u00b6 36, at 7)(emphasis in Jemez Pueblo's Br.). Jemez Pueblo adds that the United States' arguments that low population and land raids preclude a Tribe's ability to establish aboriginal title misinterprets Osage Nation of Indians v. United States, 19 Ind. Cl. Comm. 481 (1968), wherein, according to Jemez Pueblo, the ICC affirms that only successful raids and permanent encroachment can effect title extinguishment, which Jemez Pueblo maintains did not occur within the lands at issue. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 45 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 17, 38-39, at 8, 38-39; Osage Nation of Indians v. United States, 19 Ind. Cl. Comm. at 485,). 76.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that the United States' proposed facts which rely on statements made during Tribal consultation meetings and on Anschuetz' analysis are irrelevant, and cannot defeat Jemez Pueblo's exclusivity claim, because such statements and analysis lack specificity, and do not consider dominant, permissive, or joint-use between Jemez Pueblo and other Pueblos and Tribes. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 46 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 2, 30, 301-02, 305-06, 309-10, 313, 320, 436, 464, 503, 528, at 1, 11, 78-84, 88, 118, 126, 145-46, 154). 77.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo asserts that the United States \\u201cdoes little to argue the Spanish extinguished the Pueblo of Jemez's aboriginal Indian title, makes no effort to argue that Mexico did so, and instead primarily argues that extinguishment occurred after 1850 through substantial interference of \\u2024 Jemez's use of the Claim Area by private individuals or other tribes.\\u201d Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 47 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 57-59, 82-84, 86, 88-118, at 19, 24-32; Kehoe Report at 2-6, 10-17, 21-27, 34-41). 78.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that the United States misinterprets the legal standard that governs aboriginal title extinguishment when the United States asserts that \\u201cSanta Fe stands for the proposition that unrecognized aboriginal title can be extinguished by implication, based on Executive Branch action and the surrounding circumstances,\\u201d see Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 47 (quoting United States' Proposed Conclusions \\u00b6 71, at 16-17), because, according to Jemez Pueblo, the Executive Branch action and surrounding circumstances at issue in Santa Fe, i.e., an Executive Order creating an Indian reservation for the Walapai Tribe, occurred pursuant to the Tribe requesting an Indian reservation, thereby voluntarily relinquishing future land claims, and Jemez Pueblo made no similar request here, see Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 48 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1160). 79.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that the United States ignores the Court's conclusion that private land ownership does not extinguish aboriginal title absent Congressional action when the United States asserts that \\u201cinterference by the Preserve land's private owners with Plaintiff's alleged aboriginal uses prior to 2000, standing alone, is sufficient to defeat any claim to aboriginal title.\\u201d Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 49 (quoting United States' Proposed Conclusions \\u00b6\\u00b6 79-80, at 19-20). Jemez Pueblo adds that such an assertion effectively concedes that the United States did not and cannot prove that the alleged substantial interference is connected to a Congressional act. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 50. Moreover, Jemez Pueblo continues, the alleged substantial interference represents mere restrictions that the Valles Caldera's private owners placed on Jemez Pueblo members and that such restrictions did not result in Jemez Pueblo ceasing its traditional Valles Caldera use. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 50 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 83-90, 92-94, 96-101, 103, 108-11, 114-16, at 24-31).

Georgia, 31 U.S. at 546 (internal quotation marks omitted))). 82.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that the United States cites no Secretarial Order, Congressionally authorized or otherwise, which imposes use restrictions inconsistent with Jemez Pueblo's historic Valles Caldera use and which could therefore support aboriginal title extinguishment pursuant to the five-factors that, in its Oct. 25 MOO, the Court states that it will consider. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 56. 83.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argues that the statutes which Congress passed in 2000, 2005, and 2015 do not extinguish Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title, as the United States asserts, but rather protect Jemez Pueblo's ability to use the Valles Caldera and mandate that Valles Caldera staff consult with Jemez Pueblo regarding the Valles Caldera's management. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 56-58 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1172; Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 11, 350 F.

Jemez Pueblo argues further that the Court should answer in the negative the question whether the 2015 Act extinguished aboriginal Indian title, on which the Tenth Circuit remanded, because, in transferring Valles Caldera management to the National Park Service, the 2015 Act, according to Jemez Pueblo, expressly protects preexisting land rights and traditional Indian use. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 58-59 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v.

United States, 28 Fed. Cl. 768, 787-88 (1993), on which the United States relies for the proposition that a military encampment can effect extinguishment, is inapposite, because in Uintah Ute Indians of Utah v. United States, the Court of Federal Claims determined, based on undisputed facts, that the Tribe abandoned the subject lands after the military established, officially inaugurated, and expanded a permanent military fort, and here Jemez Pueblo alleges not only that it has never abandoned the Valles Caldera, but also that the outpost was temporary. See Jemez Pueblo's Br. at 59-60 (citing Uintah Ute Indians of Utah v. United States, 28 Fed. Cl. at 787). Jemez Pueblo adds that the outpost deterred Navajo raiding and thereby aided Jemez Pueblo in its Valles Caldera use.

That process allowed the Government to manipulate and misstate the evidence, and then to use the resulting confusion in a way intended to persuade the Court to adopt \\u201cfindings\\u201d that are contrary to the evidence in the record.

Jemez Pueblo argues further that any actual San Ildefonso activity within the Valles Caldera, such as the alleged eagle-hunting incident and [Redacted], is consistent with Jemez Pueblo's dominant use and other Tribes' joint or permissive use for traditional purposes, which, according to Jemez Pueblo, San Ildefonso and many other Pueblos and Tribes recognize.

Jemez Pueblo adds that Liebmann was unable to tell why Shackley identified San Ildefonso Pueblo as the obsidian's ancestral owner, because \\u201cwhen you have multiple modern day pueblos in a given ethnolinguistic group, it can be difficult to say whether a site is affiliated with one of those modern pueblos or another.

See United States' Post Trial Brief at 3, filed May 6, 2019 (Doc. 390)(\\u201cUnited States' Br.\\u201d).

See United States' Br. at 3-4 (citing Jemez Pueblo's Proposed Findings \\u00b6 286, at 103). 120.\\u2003The United States argues that the trial confirms that Keres and Tewa Pueblos occupied the Jemez Mountains' eastern slopes, including the major drainages that served as paths into the Valles Caldera, and that, since 1250 CE, these Pueblos accessed the Valles Caldara to hunt, gather plants, collect obsidian, and conduct other traditional practices.

See United States' Br. at 7 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 1-8, 10, at 1-2). 125.\\u2003The United States argues that the Valles Caldera pottery record suggests that Pueblos other than Jemez Pueblo dominated the Valles Caldera between 1250 and 1750 CE, because archeological sites that archeologists affiliate with ancestral Tewa and Keres populations are the most common sites in the southeast and south central areas of the Valles Caldera, which, according to the United States, are the areas closest to the Keres and Tewa villages, and ceramics also demonstrate that ancestral Tewa and Keres used the northern portions. See United States' Br. at 7-8 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 22-24, 539, at 6-7, 161).

The United States adds that Liebmann's analysis shows at most that Jemez Pueblo's ancestors farmed less than one percent of the Valles Caldera's southwest corner centuries before the Spanish forced Jemez Pueblo to move twenty miles south to Walatowa, which, according to the United States, is insufficient evidence to establish that Jemez Pueblo ever dominated the Valles Caldera, or even the small portion that Jemez Pueblo farmed, given that other Tribes used and traversed this area as well.

See United States' Br. at 13 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 543-59, at 162-67). 128.\\u2003The United States argues that tree-ring records suggest that no single Pueblo or Tribe controlled lands near the Valles Caldera, and that carvings on the Valles Caldera's aspens suggest that individuals associated with numerous non-Jemez communities, including six other Pueblos, used the Valles Caldera between the 1890s and the 1980s. See United States' Br. at 14 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 35-38, at 11-13). 129.\\u2003The United States argues that Jemez Pueblo's decision to jointly prosecute its ICC takings claims with the Santa Ana Pueblo and Zia Pueblo is fatal to its current claim, because the three Pueblos presented before the ICC evidence that they used a portion of the Valles Caldera in common, that Santa Clara Pueblo and San Ildefonso Pueblo used a portion of the Valles Caldera, including Redondo Peak, in a manner that would defeat the Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana, and Zia's exclusive use claim, and that Jemez Pueblo viewed Redondo Peak as its joint territory's boundary, which indicates Jemez Pueblo's belief that most of the Valles Caldera is within other Pueblos' territory. See United States' Br. at 14-16 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 35-38, at 11-13). The United States adds that former Jemez Pueblo governor Pat Toya testified before the ICC that the Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana, and Zia jointly use Redondo Peak, and other portions of the Valles Caldera, which standing alone defeats Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim.

See United States' Br. at 17 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 131-33, at 55).

See United States' Br. at 17 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 132-33, at 34-35). 131.\\u2003The United States argues that the Jicarilla Apache Nation alleged in 1958 that it had exclusive aboriginal title to the entire Valles Caldera and presented to the ICC evidence that it used the entire Valles Caldera, with its territory ranging as far south as Jemez Springs. See United States' Br. at 18 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 137-39, at 36-37).

The United States adds that Tribes attend consultation meetings only if they have interests to defend, and that such meetings with Valles Caldera staff reveal that the Jicarilla Apache, the Navajo Nation, and the Southern Ute maintain associations with the Valles Caldera, which, according to the United States, corroborates Liebmann's assertion that those Tribes likely made the Valles Caldera a dangerous place for Jemez Pueblo.

The United States adds that, although the Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana, and Zia jointly claimed before the ICC to use a portion of the Valles Caldera, Santa Ana Pueblo and Zia Pueblo have since taken positions that undermine Jemez Pueblo's efforts to show that Jemez Pueblo owns the land exclusively. See United States' Br. at 30 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 123-30, 134, 173, at 33-35, 45). 144.\\u2003The United States repeats its arguments regarding Zia Pueblo's Valles Caldera use and asserts that such use was distinct from Jemez Pueblo's use, was largely unknown to Jemez Pueblo, and was, at times, not amicable.

The United States adds that, regardless Pino's support, the Zia Pueblo Tribal Council never ratified the 2004 Memorandum of Understanding regarding Zia Pueblo support for Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera claim, which the memorandum expressly requires to take effect, and that, in 2005, Jemez Pueblo recognized that Zia Pueblo would be an obstacle to a potential, future Valles Caldera claim.

The United States adds that Jemez Pueblo cannot reasonably contend that the Valles Caldera's other aboriginal users, including the Pueblos of Cochiti, Kewa, Nambe, Picuris, Pojoaque, San Felipe, San Ildefonso, Ohkay Owingeh, Sandia, Tesuque, Santa Clara, and Zia, as well as the Jicarilla Apache, the Navajo Nation, and the Southern Ute Tribe, used those lands jointly and amicably with Jemez Pueblo.

The United States adds that, contrary to Jemez Pueblo's assertions regarding dominant use, the trial establishes that the Tewa Tribes, including Santa Clara and San Ildefonso, used the Valles Caldera even though they did not maintain sufficiently friendly relations with Jemez Pueblo to engage in trade with Jemez Pueblo before 1680 C.E.

See United States' Br. at 36-38 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 9-14, 503-08, 543-45, 547, 551, at 5-7, 145-47, 159-61). The United States adds that, aside from Liebmann explicitly rejecting the possibility that Jemez Pueblo actively guarded the Valles Caldera obsidian quarries, Jemez Pueblo offers no evidence regarding the number of trips that other Tribes' members took to Cerro del Medio's quarries or the number of Tribal members who would have been near those quarries at any given time.

The United States adds that Liebmann's admissions that other Tribes negatively affected Jemez Pueblo's access to Cerro del Medio obsidian, and that Jicarilla Apache Nation members used the Cerro del Medio obsidian source into the late 1800s or early 1900s, confirms that Jemez Pueblo did not have aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera in the nineteenth century.

The United States adds that Fogleman falsely denies that he wanted to use, but was unable to correctly use, a more sophisticated United States Geological Survey pedestrian evacuation tool which incorporates the impact of fatigue and land cover on travel times, and therefore did not incorporate land cover and slope's impact on travel time, which, according to the United States, likely biased Ferguson's model against other Pueblos, such as the Pueblos of Cochiti, Santa Clara, and San Ildefonso, who walk through flat, easily traversed meadows on their way to Redondo Peak. See United States' Br. at 41-42 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 522-24, at 151-52). 152.\\u2003The United States argues that the trial establishes that Zia Pueblo has used the Valles Caldera for centuries in a manner not subject to Jemez Pueblo's dominion, including for pilgrimages throughout the Valles Caldera many times per year from the prehispanic era to the 1970s, and that Zia Pueblo communicated knowledge regarding the Valles Caldera's landscape to Captain Francisco Barrionuevo during the 1541 Coronado expedition.

The United States adds that, even if having place names could be probative of a Tribe or a Pueblo's dominance, the trial establishes that multiple Tribes and Pueblos named places within the Valles Caldera; for example, the sixteen Zia Pueblo place names that Ellis identified in 1980.

See United States' Br. at 45 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6 55, at 18). 156.\\u2003The United States argues that Jemez Pueblo's oral history does not include stories wherein Jemez Pueblo members drive off members from the Jicarilla Apache, Ute, Santa Clara Pueblo, or San Ildefonso Pueblo, that the evidence instead indicates that these Tribes and Pueblos exercised dominion over Jemez Pueblo, and that the Jicarilla Apache in particular had easy access to the Valles Caldera from its nineteenth century population centers, from which it pilgrimaged to worship at Redondo Peak and to peel Banco Bonito trees, among other activities.

Toya and Juanito Medina, Ellis acknowledges that the Pueblos of Santa Ana, Jemez, and Zia might have considered including the Valles Caldera in their joint land claims but for their knowledge that other Tribes used the lands, which, according to the United States, constitutes an admission that Jemez Pueblo knew that, if it had ever held aboriginal title to any portion of the Valles Caldera, it had lost that title by 1951, and that Ellis' statement that other Tribes considered the Valles Caldera sacred and used it for rituals is an explicit and credible admission that the Pueblos of Santa Ana, Jemez, and Zia were not the Valles Caldera's joint aboriginal users.

The United States adds that, after the Pueblo Revolt, Spain reaffirmed that it had extinguished Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title when Spain formally granted the remaining Jemez Pueblo population the 17,500 acres that encompass Walatowa, which, according to the United States, is the land title that the United States confirmed in 1858.

Pueblo of San Ildefonso to illustrate how interference defeats a claim based on actual and continuous use. See United States' Br. at 74-76 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166-67). 174.\\u2003The United States further argues that the Court should disregard Jemez Pueblo's collateral attacks on the ICC's legitimacy, because Jemez Pueblo introduced no evidence at the trial undermining the ICC's legitimacy and instead relies on unintroduced documents that Jemez Pueblo appended to its motion in limine, a practice to which the United States objects. See United States' Br. at 76 (citing Jemez Pueblo's Proposed Conclusions \\u00b6\\u00b6 6, 101, at 2-7, 57-60). The United States adds that the parties in United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso resolved their dispute in a manner which disproves Jemez Pueblo's suggestion that San Ildefonso Pueblo's attorneys were biased, because, according to the United States, San Ildefonso Pueblo negotiated a Congressionally approved settlement that returned 7,100 acres to San Ildefonso Pueblo, which indicates to the United States that, if San Ildefonso could pursue a trespass action in the ICC, Jemez Pueblo could also pursue such an action.

See United States' Br. at 79 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 248, 335, at 66, 93). 178.\\u2003The United States argues that Jemez Pueblo's post-2000 Valles Caldera use is not probative whether Jemez Pueblo possessed aboriginal title before 2000, because, according to the United States, Jemez Pueblo dramatically increased its Valles Caldera use after 2000 to buttress its aboriginal title claims, which, the United States insists, merely serves to highlight Jemez Pueblo's minimal Valles Caldera use before 2000.

According to the United States, Jemez Pueblo used the Valles Caldera infrequently between 2000 and 2005, but in 2005 connected its Valles Caldera use to its QTA claim and thereafter dramatically increased such use, which resulted in dozens of formal access requests that Jemez Pueblo leadership facilitated and, in at least one instance, mandated for all Tribal employees.

The United States notes that Santa Clara Pueblo and Zia Pueblo did not pass resolutions supporting Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera claim, and adds that many Tribes and Pueblos, including the Hopi Tribe, and the Navajo Nation, and the Pueblos of Laguna, Santa Clara, and Tesuque made statements at consultation meetings which reveal that they do not view the Valles Caldera as exclusive to Jemez Pueblo, and instead indicate that those Tribes consider the Valles Caldera both sacred and a commons.

The United States adds that Jemez Pueblo's Ojo del Espiritu Santu grant acquisition stands in contrast to Jemez Pueblo's effort to obtain United States' land under the QTA, because Jemez Pueblo's ICC case sought compensation for its interest in the Ojo del Espiritu Santu grant, a portion of which Jemez Pueblo ultimately obtained only through statute, similar to how Taos Pueblo and Zia Pueblo obtained title to lands over which they asserted aboriginal title only through statute, and here Congress has declined to further extend Jemez Pueblo's land base, which, according to the United States, \\u201ctherefore militates in favor of finding that Congress extinguished any interest Plaintiff might have possessed in the Preserve lands.\\u201d United States' Br. at 88 (citing Act of August 2, 1956, Pub.

Moreover, the United States continues, Congress completed its Valles Caldera acquisition in 2006, when it passed legislation authorizing the United States to condemn the Valles Caldera's outstanding mineral interests for approximately $3,800,000.00. See United States' Br. at 95 (citing United States v. Harrell, 642 F.3d 907, 910-11 (10th Cir. 2011); United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6 210, at 56). 185.\\u2003The United States argues that the trial establishes that, in 2015, Congress again declined to transfer the Valles Caldera to Jemez Pueblo, and instead transferred those lands to the National Park Service, which, according to the United States, is an action that per se extinguished Jemez Pueblo's unrecognized aboriginal title, because it explicitly created rights for other Tribes and Pueblos, including Santa Clara Pueblo and San Ildefonso Pueblo, rejected precisely the relief that Jemez Pueblo seeks in this case, and imposed on the Valles Caldera a statutory management scheme that is inconsistent with alleged aboriginal rights, including the requirement that Redondo Peak remain accessible to other Tribes and Pueblos. See United States' Br. at 95-96. The United States adds that, in contrast to Jemez Pueblo's unqualified support for the United States' acquisition in 2000, Jemez Pueblo in 2010 for the first time asserted its aboriginal title claim before Congress. See United States' Br. at 96-97 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 211-16, at 56-58). 186.\\u2003The United States argues that the trial also establishes that the Preservation Act and transfer to the National Park Service together not only restrict Jemez Pueblo's alleged historic use for hunting, but also permit members of other Tribes and the public to visit Redondo Peak in a manner that is contrary to Jemez Pueblo's religious values, because, according to the United States, Jemez Pueblo currently is opposed to non-Jemez Pueblo members visiting Redondo Peak, yet, under the National Park Service, the entire Valles Caldera is open to pedestrian access. See United States' Br. at 98 (citing Nat'l Def. Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 698v-11(b)(1), (c)(1), 128 Stat. 3292, 3792-96 (Dec. 19, 2014); United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 204-05, 212-13, at 54-57). 187.\\u2003The United States argues that Santa Clara Pueblo is a necessary and indispensable party to this litigation, because Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera claim threatens Santa Clara Pueblo's many interests in the Valles Caldera, including its \\u201csettled expectation\\u201d that it can continue to worship on Redondo Peak. See United States' Br. at 99 (citing Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 19). The United States acknowledges that, in the SJ Order, the Court concludes that Santa Clara Pueblo is not a necessary and indispensable party to this case and expressed confidence in the United States' ability to defend Santa Clara Pueblo's interests in the United States' continued Valles Caldera stewardship, but nevertheless urges the Court to reexamine the United States rule 19 argument, because, according to the United States, the SJ Order considers primarily Santa Clara Pueblo's conservation and access easement and because the trial establishes that Santa Clara Pueblo has longstanding Valles Caldera interests not yet admitted during the summary judgment stage. See United States' Br. at 99-100 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 317, 324-25, 353, 358, 374-78, 489, 508-13, 608-10, 623, at 86-89, 98-99, 105, 139-40, 147, 175-76, 180). The United States adds that Santa Clara Pueblo does not believe that the United States can adequately represent its interests in this case, that Santa Clara Pueblo's religious leaders prohibit sharing specific information regarding Santa Clara Pueblo's Valles Caldera use, and that the [Redacted] See United States' Br. at 101 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 334, 338, 358, at 93-94, 99). 188.\\u2003The United States argues that Zia Pueblo's long-standing cultural and religious interests in, for example, [Redacted] together with Jemez Pueblo's opposition to Zia Pueblo's Redondo Peak use, makes Zia Pueblo a necessary party to this case.

See United States' Br. at 102 n.43. 190.\\u2003The United States argues that, similar to Cochiti Pueblo's Tribal resolution, San Ildefonso Pueblo passed its Tribal resolution supporting Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera claim only after receiving assurances that Jemez Pueblo would permit San Ildefonso Pueblo to continue its traditional Valles Caldera use, which includes worship on Redondo Peak, yet, according to the United States, Jemez Pueblo does not consider such worship a traditional use for Pueblos other than Jemez Pueblo.

See United States' Br. at 104 (citing N. Arapaho Tribe v. Harnsberger, 697 F.3d 1272, 1281 (10th Cir. 2012); United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6 357, at 99). 193.\\u2003The United States argues that, because joinder is infeasible, the Court must consider four factors -- (i) prejudice; (ii) the extent that prejudice can be avoided; (iii) adequacy of a judgment rendered in the party's absence; and (iv) whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the Court dismissed the action for nonjoinder -- to determine whether it should dismiss the case, the balance of which, according to the United States, weighs in dismissal's favor. See United States' Br. at 104 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b)). The United States argues that Jemez Pueblo's threat to multiple Pueblos' interests within the Valles Caldera evidences prejudice sufficient to satisfy the first factor. See United States' Br. at 104-05 (citing N. Arapaho Tribe v. Harnsberger, 697 F.3d at 1281). The United States argues that the Court cannot lessen or avoid the prejudice, because judgment in Jemez Pueblo's favor would restrict multiple Pueblo's access to cultural and religious sites within the Valles Caldera, which, according to the United States, satisfies the second factor. See United States' Br. at 105 (citing N. Arapaho Tribe v. Harnsberger, 697 F.3d at 1282-83; United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 334, 373-78, 508-13, at 93, 104-105, 147). The United States argues that, at a minimum, judgment in Santa Clara Pueblo's absence would be inadequate, because resolving the case without Santa Clara Pueblo could create future disputes between Jemez Pueblo and Santa Clara Pueblo over Valles Caldera access, and the Pueblos' sovereign immunity would likely lead to results that are inconsistent with this case, which, according to the United States, satisfies the third factor. See United States' Br. at 105-06 (citing N. Arapaho Tribe v. Harnsberger, 697 F.3d at 1283; United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6 358, at 99). The United States argues that Santa Clara Pueblo's, and other Tribes' and Pueblos', sovereign immunity leaves the Court with no room to balance the fourth rule 19(b) factor, because the Court cannot exercise its authority to join such entities, a fact which standing alone favors dismissal, according to the United States. See United States' Br. at 106-07 (citing Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez, 436 U.S. 49, 58, 98 S.Ct. 1670, 56 L.Ed.2d 106; Davis v. United States, 343 F.3d 1282, 1293 (10th Cir. 2003)). 194.\\u2003The United States argues that, because the Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana, and Zia presented evidence showing that they jointly used areas within the Valles Caldera, including Redondo Peak, to the ICC, because the Court of Claims issued a final judgment on the merits of the three Pueblos' claim for aboriginal title extinguishment, and because, according to the United States, the present action is essentially identical to the prior claim, section 22(a) of the ICCA bars Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera claim.

The United States adds that, although Gauthier cited to an article that Steffen wrote in 2017, Gauthier did not adopt Steffen's conclusions from her expert report but instead for his report conducted his own independent and objective analysis, which, according to the United States, shows that diverse people used the Valles Caldera for many centuries until private owners substantially altered such use.

The United States adds that, standing alone, Whatley's ancestral lands work has limited evidentiary value, because Whatley exclusively relied on Jemez Pueblo members attempting to piece together their ancestors' centuries-old activities, and because Whatley's maps do not depict other Tribes' understanding of Jemez Pueblo's boundaries, which cannot support Jemez Pueblo's arguments regarding dominance or exclusivity. See United States' Br. at 140-41 (citing United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6 473, at 132). Moreover, the United States continues, Whatley's methodology indicates that certain sites labeled \\u201cancestral Puebloan\\u201d have a Tewa or Keres affiliation based on ceramics analysis, which, according to the United States, shows that Jemez Pueblo recognizes that other Pueblos use or used portions of the Valles Caldera either exclusively or jointly with Jemez Pueblo. See United States' Br. at 141-42 (citing Jemez Pueblo's Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 51, 259, 320, at 20, 96, 111; United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 10, 20-22, 471, 474, 539, at 5, 9-10, 131-33, 157-58). 210.\\u2003The United States argues that Jemez Pueblo misstates the record to argue that Kelley's opinions in her expert report are more credible than Anschuetz' opinions, because, according to the United States, although Kelley and Anschuetz have occasionally collaborated and corresponded during the past two decades, Anschuetz, in reaching his conclusion that the Valles Caldera is a commons, independently reviewed and evaluated Kelley's sources, including sources which demonstrate that the Navajo Nation maintains a deep connection to the Valles Caldera, and that Navajo Nation members historically traversed and gathered obsidian from the Valles Caldera, and lived on a ridge bordering the Valles Caldera's Valle Toldeo in the early twentieth century. See United States' Br. at 142-44 (citing Jemez Pueblo's Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 35-36, 546, at 12, 163-64; United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 56, 313, 445-46, 571, at 18-19, 83-84, 120, 168). 211.\\u2003The United States argues that Gauthier's knowledge of and familiarity with ancestral Puebloan sites gleaned from four decades of fieldwork in the American southwest is superior to Liebmann's experience, and further criticizes Liebmann for spending merely one day inspecting and analyzing the Valles Caldera's ceramics collection, during which Liebmann personally examined sherds from only one site, according to the United States, and for otherwise relying on Roney's analysis and conclusions regarding a given sherd's affiliation. See United States' Br. at 144-45 (citing Jemez Pueblo's Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 45-46, at 16-18; United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 15-16, 535-36, at 7-8, 156). The United States adds that Jemez Pueblo mischaracterizes Gauthier's testimony regarding the presence of some Jemez Pueblo pottery sherds at sites affiliated with non-Jemez Pueblo pottery, because, according to the United States, Gauthier never testified that \\u201carchaeologists do not find Jemez Black-on-White at a non-Jemez site,\\u201d but instead explains that Jemez Pueblo pottery typically is not found at a Tewa-affiliated site, because those two groups did not engage in trade before the Pueblo Revolt, and that archeologists therefore assign a Tewa affiliation to sites containing pre-Revolt Tewa ceramics. United States' Br. at 144-45 (citing Jemez Pueblo's Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 46, 433, 492, at 17-18, 138, 148-49; United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 18-25, 350, 532-33, 539-40, at 8-10, 97, 155-58). The United States repeats its argument that Gauthier concludes at the trial that the Valles Caldera ceramics record shows that Keres and Tewa people predominantly used the southeast and south central portions of the Valles Caldera, that ancestral Jemez Pueblo members predominately used the Valles Caldera's extreme southwestern corner, and that all three language groups used the Valles Caldera's northern portions, which establishes, according to the United States, that Jemez Pueblo did not dominate the Valles Caldera. See United States' Br. at 147-48 (citing Jemez Pueblo's Proposed Findings \\u00b6 490, at 148; United States' Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 22-25, 532, 539, at 9-10, 155, 157). 13.\\u2003Closing Arguments. 212.\\u2003On May 7, 2019, the Court heard closing arguments for the bench trial. See Draft Transcript of Hearing at 35:24-36:10 (taken Oct. 11, 2018)(\\u201cMay 7 Tr.\\u201d). Jemez Pueblo first discussed aboriginal title generally and then distinguished Anglo land use, which, according to Jemez Pueblo, is primarily a means to support commerce, from American Indian land use, which imparts to land great spiritual significance. See May 7 Tr. at 4:15-6:11 (West). Jemez Pueblo next discussed cultural differences among Tribes. See May 7 Tr. at 6:12-7:1 (West). Jemez Pueblo then argued that its aboriginal title pre-dates Western Europe's and United States' first contact with American Indians pursuant to legal doctrine that European and American law recognizes. See May 7 Tr. at 7:2-8:2 (West). Jemez Pueblo discussed the elements that courts require Tribes to prove to succeed in an aboriginal title claim. See May 7 Tr. at 8:2-10 (West). Jemez Pueblo asserted that the trial provided the Court with evidence sufficient to establish that Jemez Pueblo has used the Valles Caldera for centuries. See May 7 Tr. at 8:11-9:3 (West). 213.\\u2003The Court asked Jemez Pueblo to reconcile its assertion that it was the Valles Caldera's dominant user with the \\u201cextensive evidence\\u201d which shows that other Tribes were using the Valles Caldera at the same time. May 7 Tr. at 9:9-10:1 (Court). Jemez Pueblo responded that the evidence before the Court indicates both that Jemez Pueblo was the Valles Caldera's dominant user and also that Jemez Pueblo permitted other Tribes Valles Caldera use. See May 7 Tr. at 10:2-5 (West). The Court replied that it does not see in the record evidence that other Tribes requested permission to use the Valles Caldera from Jemez Pueblo. See May 7 Tr. at 10:6-12 (Court). Jemez Pueblo argued that long-standing \\u201cTribal customs\\u201d allow for \\u201climited traditional practices,\\u201d \\u201csimilar to a well established easement or a license or a conditional license upon which an owner has said [\\u2018]yes \\u2024 [you] can come onto my land and you can gather this plant or in certain cases game for traditional uses. And if it's not traditional uses we object to it.[\\u2019]\\u201d May 7 Tr. at 10:16-11:1 (West). Jemez Pueblo cited an incident on Redondo Peak as an example of Jemez Pueblo objecting to nontraditional use. See May 7 Tr. at 11:2-4 (West). The Court expressed its reluctance to say whether one Tribe's Valles Caldera use is traditional or nontraditional, which the Court analogized to making a decision regarding a given Tribe's religion. See May 7 Tr. at 11:7-25 (Court). Jemez Pueblo responded that Tribes can distinguish traditional from nontraditional use and \\u201cknow very well the difference in those customs.\\u201d May 7 Tr. at 12:2-16 (West). The Court asked for Jemez Pueblo's top three permissive use examples, and Jemez Pueblo argued that the archeological record and contemporary witness testimony, specifically Cochiti Pueblo member Suina's testimony regarding gathering wood from the Valles Caldera, evidence permissive use. See May 7 Tr. at 12:19-13:22 (Court, West). The Court asked for one example where a Tribe recognized Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title and expressly asked permission to use the Valles Caldera, and Jemez Pueblo asserted that such permission need not be explicit. See May 7 Tr. at 14:2-9 (West). The Court stated that it would not necessarily hold Jemez Pueblo to an explicit-permission standard, and Jemez Pueblo averred that the Tribal resolutions confirm permissive use. See May 7 Tr. at 14:10-15:12 (Court, West). 214.\\u2003The Court expressed that, in the Court's opinion, the Tribal resolutions indicate limited support for Jemez Pueblo, which \\u201cbroke down\\u201d when such support conflicted with Tribes' self-interests. May 7 Tr. at 15:17-16:13 (Court). Jemez Pueblo disputed the Court's assessment and argued that Santa Clara Pueblo is, in Jemez Pueblo's opinion, the only Tribe that shifted its position. See May 7 Tr. at 17:10-19:12 (West). 215.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argued that the United States seeks to revise aboriginal title law and asks the Court to ignore longstanding precedent which dictates that only Congress can take aboriginal lands from American Indians. See May 7 Tr. at 19:18-21:18 (West). Moreover, argued Jemez Pueblo, the evidence that the United States presents regarding Valles Caldera use after Spanish arrival is irrelevant unless such evidence speaks to abandonment or to Congressional action, which the United States' evidence, according to Jemez Pueblo, does not. See May 7 Tr. at 21:19-22:5 (West). 216.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo summarized the evidence that it presented at trial, which includes testimony from Jemez Pueblo members, scientists, academics, and European and American written records. See May 7 Tr. at 22:6-26:21 (West). Jemez Pueblo added that the United States has not presented evidence to refute Jemez Pueblo's continuous Valles Caldera use for many centuries and instead asks the Court to create additional precedent that the law does not recognize. See May 7 Tr. at 26:22-27:9 (West). 217.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo summarized Ferguson's testimony and expert report, which, according to Jemez Pueblo, evinces a rigorous methodology that stands in contrast to Anschuetz' broad generalizations and failure to limit his analysis to the Valles Caldera proper. See May 7 Tr. at 27:10-29:5. 218.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo summarized Liebmann's testimony regarding the archeological record, and the Court asked Jemez Pueblo to refresh the Court's memory whether Liebmann focused exclusively on Jemez Pueblo archeology or studied other Tribes as well. See May 7 Tr. at 29:23-30:4 (Court). Jemez Pueblo responded that Liebmann opined regarding dominant use and exclusive use as to ceramics, obsidian, and [Redacted], and thereafter summarized for the Court Liebmann's conclusions as to each category. See May 7 Tr. at 30:5-32:10 (West). 219.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo summarized Gauthier's testimony, which, despite ignoring and statistically manipulating the evidence, according to Jemez Pueblo, nevertheless supports Liebmann's conclusions regarding Jemez Pueblo's dominance over the Valles Caldera's obsidian quarries, among other sites. See May 7 Tr. at 32:11-33:22 (West). 220.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo summarized Garc\\u00eda y Griego's testimony regarding activities in the Jemez Mountains during Spanish contact and thereafter, and argued that, consistent with the archeological evidence, the historical evidence also supports Jemez Pueblo's assertion that its ancestral domain encompasses the Valles Caldera. See May 7 Tr. at 33:22-35:3 (West). 221.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo summarized Whatley's testimony and mapping project, which, according to Jemez Pueblo, provide the Court with credible and consistent evidence regarding Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal boundaries. See May 7 Tr. at 35:4-36:22 (West). 222.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo summarized Fogleman's testimony regarding the Valles Caldera geography and Jemez River watershed, which, according to Jemez Pueblo, traverses the Jemez Pueblo's ancestral domain, passing through historic villages and Walatowa, and in this way provides a natural boundary similar to how the Santa Clara Creek watershed provides Santa Clara Pueblo's natural boundary. See May 7 Tr. at 36:22-38:14 (West). 223.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo asserted that the numerous Banco Bonito fieldhouses and large, ancestral Jemez Pueblo villages near the Valles Caldera support Jemez Pueblo's exclusivity arguments, and are, according to Jemez Pueblo, the only credible evidence of architecture within the Valles Caldera, [Redacted]. See May 7 Tr. at 38:15-40:6 (West). 224.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo made arguments regarding longstanding agreements and relationships among the Pueblos as to joint, amicable, and permissive use. See May 7 Tr. at 40:8-41:2 (West). 225.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo again discussed Fogleman's geospatial analysis, which it argued supports Liebmann's conclusion regarding Jemez Pueblo's dominant Valles Caldera use, and contrasted Fogleman's analysis with Gauther's, who, according to Jemez Pueblo, ignored or disregarded evidence in the ceramics record as to Jemez Pueblo's Banco Bonito use. See May 7 Tr. at 41:2-42:7 (West). Nevertheless, Jemez Pueblo argued, Gauthier's conclusions support Jemez Pueblo's dominant use assertions. See May 7 Tr. at 42:12-16 (West). 226.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo criticized Steffen's research and conclusions on Valles Caldera obsidian for focusing on areas outside the Valles Caldera and for not studying obsidian found at ancestral Jemez Pueblo villages. See May 7 Tr. at 42:20-43:11 (West). 227.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo elaborated on its permissive use arguments and analogized other Tribes' Valles Caldera use to Jemez Pueblo visiting Mount Taylor\\u2009 or Sandia Peak, or to tourists visiting Notre-Dame de Paris in France to illustrate that individuals or groups may consider a given site sacred while not having a legally cognizable property interest in the site. See May 7 Tr. at 44:5-21 (West). Jemez Pueblo directed the Court to testimony from Cochiti Pueblo and Taos Pueblo as evidence that Tribes permit each other to use aboriginal land while understanding that such use does not affect their title to the property. See May 7 Tr. at 44:21-46:10 (West). Jemez Pueblo added that the Tribal resolutions codify the Tribes' permissive land use for traditional, customary purposes. See May 7 Tr. at 46:11-47:25 (West). 228.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo asserted that, even if the Court considers relevant evidence of Valles Caldera use after Spanish arrival, the record, according to Jemez Pueblo, still supports that Jemez Pueblo is the Valles Caldera's dominant user, and highlighted the Navajo raids which, according to Jemez Pueblo, evince that Jemez Pueblo fought and repelled the Navajo Nation from the Valles Caldera. See May 7 Tr. at 47:9-24 (West). The Court expressed that the evidence indicates that the Navajo Nation used the Valles Caldera as a crossroads, and Jemez Pueblo responded that, although the Court heard testimony regarding Navajo Nation trails through the Valles Caldera, such use does not affect Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title, because the Navajo Nation used the trails to raid other Pueblos. See May 7 Tr. at 47:25-48:15 (Court, West). 229.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argued that no Jemez Pueblo members testified to seeing members from other Pueblos use the Valles Caldera, aside from the single incident involving Zia Pueblo in 2001. See May 7 Tr. at 48:18-22 (West). Jemez Pueblo added that both Whatley and Dunigan also testified to never seeing members from Tribes other than Jemez Pueblo use the Valles Caldera. See May 7 Tr. at 48:22-49:22 (West). 230.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argued that its numerous Valles Caldera access requests prove continuous use, that most Tribes whom the United States asserts have an interest in the Valles Caldera have never requested access, and that the remaining Tribes have made only sporadic and infrequent requests. See May 7 Tr. at 50:1-51:7 (West). Such demonstrated, continuous use, contended Jemez Pueblo, is the reason that Valles Caldera staff repeatedly have requested Jemez Pueblo -- but not other Tribes -- to assist with numerous activities such as speaking to field schools and offering preliminary opinions regarding archeological sites. See May 7 Tr. at 51:8-23 (West). 231.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argued that, because it has established aboriginal title, the only question left for the Court to consider is whether Congress extinguished Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title, evidence of which, according to Jemez Pueblo, the Court has not seen. See May 7 Tr. at 52:18-54:2 (West). 232.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo disagreed with the United States' theory that non-Indians' substantial interference can effect aboriginal title extinguishment and disputed the legal basis for the Court requiring that such interference could effect title extinguishment when tied to Congressional action. See May 7 Tr. at 54:3-59:6 (West, Court). Jemez Pueblo argued that, regardless its disagreement with the United States and the Court, the substantial interference that the United States cites is not only not tied to a congressional act, but is also not substantial interference, because multiple Jemez Pueblo witnesses testified that the Valles Caldera's private owners permitted Jemez Pueblo to continue their traditional practices. See May 7 Tr. at 59:8-61:4 (West). 233.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argued that congressional action regarding the Valles Caldera does not indicate that Congress authorized substantial interference, but rather that Congress merely acted to approve and sanction prior sovereign's land grants, and added that the Tenth Circuit has already rejected the United States' argument that the 1860 grant to the Baca heirs extinguished Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title. See May 7 Tr. at 61:4-62:10 (West). 234.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo contested the United States' assertion that Congress extinguished Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title when it purchased the Valles Caldera in 2000, and through subsequent legislation in 2005 and 2015, because those actions neither restricted Jemez Pueblo's traditional uses nor prevented Jemez Pueblo from using the land according to its predilections. See May 7 Tr. at 62:11-64:6 (West). 235.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argued that the United States, in addition to asking the Court to create new law, has taken evidence out of context, and alternately ignored and trivialized Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use, specifically by arguing that Jemez Pueblo has manufactured and staged evidence. See May 7 Tr. at 64:7-66:7 (West). As support for its position that the United States is mischaracterizing the evidence in this case, Jemez Pueblo cited the United States' assertion that, in the twentieth century, Navajo hogans were located along the ridge bordering the Valle Toldeo in the Valles Caldera's northeast section. See May 7 Tr. at 66:9-67:1 (West). Similarly, Jemez Pueblo argued that the United States frequently equates Tribes' Jemez Mountains use with Tribes' Valles Caldera use, and thereby stretches its facts to reach broad and unsupported conclusions. See May 7 Tr. at 67:1-67:13 (West). 236.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo asked the Court not to give the same weight to broad statements that Pueblos made at listening sessions with Valles Caldera staff and management, and instead to weigh more heavily Jemez Pueblo's statements that describe actual and continuous Valles Caldera use. See May 7 Tr. at 67:18-13 (West). 237.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argued that the United States manipulated its witnesses, for example, by withholding Whatley's GIS information from Gauthier. See May 7 Tr. at 67:24-68:19 (West). 238.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo discussed its migration history and insisted that, through prayers, songs, and dances, which Jemez Pueblo members have passed down through generations, the Valles Caldera plays a central role in that history, and concluded by asking the Court to recognize its aboriginal title to those lands. See May 7 Tr. at 68:20-69:25 (West). 239.\\u2003The Court expressed that it is struggling most with the question whether Jemez Pueblo ever had aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera, because the archeological and ethnological evidence received at trial indicates the many Tribes and indigenous peoples who predate modern Tribes were using the Valles Caldera for millennia. See May 7 Tr. at 70:1-22 (Court). Jemez Pueblo replied that, although the lack of written evidence presents a challenge for the Court, the record nonetheless supports Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim, because courts have relied on archeological and ethnological evidence in other aboriginal title cases. See May 7 Tr. at 70:23-71:8 (West). The Court replied that the absence of written documentation is not a bar to Jemez Pueblo's claim, and Jemez Pueblo added that the careful manner through which Jemez Pueblo members pass down their oral traditions preserves the information's accuracy and credibility. See May 7 Tr. at 71:9-72:21 (Court, West). 240.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo reminded the Court that the preponderance of the evidence standard governs the case, and asserted that a preponderance of the ceramics, obsidian, historical, and geographic evidence proves Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use and occupancy. See May 7 Tr. at 72:21-73:4 (West). 241.\\u2003The United States began its argument by asserting three points: first, that the Valles Caldera has \\u201cbeen a tribal commons used by many and \\u2024 exclusive to none,\\u201d and thus has never been Jemez Pueblo's exclusive domain; second, that, pursuant to Congress' 1860 grant to the Baca heirs, the Valles Caldera's private owners substantially interfered with Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use; and third, that Congress recognized the Valles Caldera's nonexclusive nature when it specifically provided for Santa Clara Pueblo, San Ildefonso Pueblo and other federally recognized Tribes in the Valles Caldera's management plan. May 7 Tr. at 74:4-15 (Marinelli). 242.\\u2003The United States asserted that the physical evidence presented at trial defeats Jemez Pueblo's suggestion that it was the Valles Caldera's exclusive user, because such evidence proves that, like Jemez Pueblo, other Pueblos had ancestral villages near the Valles Caldera. See May 7 Tr. at 74:16-23 (Marinelli). 243.\\u2003The Court asked the United States to address Jemez Pueblo's contention that experts predominantly associate the ceramics evidence with Jemez Pueblo, and the United States responded that such evidence is almost exclusively confined to the Banco Bonito. See May 7 Tr. at 74:24-75:23 (Court, Marinelli). The Court then asked the United States whether the Court properly can find that Jemez Pueblo has aboriginal title merely to a portion of the Valles Caldera, and the United States responded that, although the Court legally could make such a finding, the facts do not support it, because, according to the United States, Jemez Pueblo never farmed the Banco Bonito continuously and has not farmed the Banco Bonito since 1650, which the United States insisted is proof both that Jemez Pueblo never had and did not maintain aboriginal title to that area. See May 7 Tr. at 75:24-76:20 (Court, Marinelli). Regarding title establishment, the United States argued that Jeremy Kulisheck, whom Liebmann acknowledged as an expert on Banco Bonito archeology, concluded in 2003 that Jemez Pueblo likely had not farmed the Banco Bonito since 1425, and, therefore, Jemez Pueblo did not have aboriginal title pursuant to Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title establishment theory as the United States understands it, which requires use when the Spanish arrived in 1541. See May 7 Tr. at 76:21-77:23 (Marinelli, Court). The United States argued that, unlike fee simple title, aboriginal title is not fixed, but can shift over time and therefore must be maintained; hence, according to the United States, Jemez Pueblo must prove that it had aboriginal title in 2000, the date on which Jemez Pueblo insists that a taking occurred. See May 7 Tr. at 78:1-79:7 (Court, Marinelli). The United States added that Jemez Pueblo has not occupied Hot Springs Pueblo, which, according to the United States, is the closest village to the Valles Caldera, since 1500, and has not occupied Unshagi and Nanishagi since before 1650, when Jemez Pueblo alleges, according to the United States, that Jemez Pueblo ceased farming the Banco Bonito. See May 7 Tr. at 79:8-16 (Marinelli). 244.\\u2003The United States argued that the Spanish eliminated Jemez Pueblo's interest in the Banco Bonito, and the Valles Caldera as a whole, when they removed Jemez Pueblo to Walatowa and forced it to remain there. See May 7 Tr. at 79:17-80:5 (Marinelli). 245.\\u2003The United States argued that, during the ICC litigation in the 1950s and again in the 1980s, Jemez Pueblo conceded that it used the Valles Caldera jointly with Santa Ana Pueblo and Zia Pueblo. See May 7 Tr. at 80:5-15 (Marinelli). 246.\\u2003The United States argued that Zia Pueblo did not merely wander through areas within the Valles Caldera, including the Banco Bonito, but instead engaged in purposeful, religiously motivated travel before and after Spanish contact in 1541. See May 7 Tr. at 80:16-81:2 (Marinelli). The Court asked why traveling through an area is significant, and the United States directed the Court to Wichita Indian Tribe v. United States, 696 F.2d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 1983), for the proposition that, where adverse Tribes travel through land for hunting purposes or wanders over land, no single Tribe can successfully assert ownership, which is the case here, according to the United States, because Zia Pueblo's travel and use was never subject to Jemez Pueblo's permission. See May 7 Tr. at 81:3-82:5 (Court, Marinelli). 247.\\u2003The United States reminded the Court that the Jicarilla Apache Nation claimed the entire Valles Caldera during its ICC litigation, asserted that it worshiped on Redondo Peak, peeled bark from trees within the Valles Caldera, and, according to Jemez Pueblo's own admission, made life difficult for Jemez Pueblo from the 1600s onward, which, according to the United States, is further evidence that Jemez Pueblo never dominated the area. See May 7 Tr. at 82:5-24 (Marinelli). 248.\\u2003The United States argued that Anschuetz' maps depict the distance from ancestral Pueblos to Cerro del Medio, which, according to the United States, is for many Tribes culturally significant, and show that Pueblos larger than Jemez Pueblo are closer than Jemez Pueblo to key areas with the Valles Caldera. See May 7 Tr. at 83:25-84:14 (Marinelli). The United States added that these Pueblos were occupied between 1300 and 1700 C.E., and that two such Pueblos contained 3,200 rooms and are located within a few miles of the Valles Caldera's boundaries. See May 7 Tr. at 83:15-84:1 (Court, Marinelli). The Court inquired why Anschuetz chose that specific date range, and the United States responded that Anschuetz adopted the date range from Fogleman's work, which, according to the United States, excluded several ancestral Pueblos that Anschuetz and Gauthier noted. See May 7 Tr. at 84:4-15 (Court, Marinelli). 249.\\u2003The United States argued that both Anschuetz and Liebmann provided testimony regarding Jicarilla Apache settlements near the Valles Caldera, and that Liebmann specifically acknowledged that Jicarilla Apache members collected Cerro del Medio obsidian before camping at a site used during the turn of the twentieth century. See May 7 Tr. at 84:21-85:7 (Marinelli). 250.\\u2003The United States argued that the archeologists have found Valles Caldera obsidian at many Pueblo sites located to the Valles Caldera's east and southeast, and suggested that Liebmann disregarded these sites because such evidence would undercut his conclusion that Jemez Pueblo used Valles Caldera obsidian to a degree far greater than any other Pueblo. See May 7 Tr. at 85:8-86:19 (Marinelli). 251.\\u2003The United States argued that the Pueblos of Jemez, Zia, and Santa Ana's joint claim before the ICC independently defeats Jemez Pueblo's claim in this case, because, during the ICC litigation, then-Jemez Pueblo governor Pat Toya asserted that the three Pueblos share Redondo Peak, with the more eastern Pueblos accessing the mountain from the east and the more western Pueblos accessing the mountain from the west. See May 7 Tr. at 86:20-88:11 (Marinelli). The Court asked whether the United States consideres Toya's statement accurate or merely an attempt to state a large claim area before the ICC, and the United States responded that Toya's statement supports the United States' position that the Valles Caldera has always been a commons with many Pueblos asserting multiple and sometimes inconsistent views regarding land ownership and use. See May 7 Tr. at 88:12-89:1 (Court, Marinelli). 252.\\u2003The Court asked whether the ICC or other courts have used the phrase \\u201cTribal commons,\\u201d and expressed reluctance about inventing a term, and the United States responded that the phrase is implicit in the legal standard that the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit articulated in Wichita Indian Tribe v. United States, and that San Ildefonso Pueblo used the phrase while lobbying Congress in 1997 and 1998. May 7 Tr. at 89:2-17 (Court, Marinelli). The United States suggested that the Court consider the phase to indicate merely that Jemez Pueblo has not met its burden, because the phrase connotes that Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use was not exclusive, dominant, or permissive. See May 7 Tr. at 89:18-25 (Marinelli). The Court asked whether the phrase is inconsistent with the United States' theory, because, from the Court's perspective, \\u201cTribal commons\\u201d indicates that many people possess the land, and the United States is arguing that many Tribes used and use it, but no single Tribe possesses it, May 7 Tr. at 90:1-9 (Court), to which the United States responded that merely using land is insufficient to establish aboriginal title; \\u201cplaintiff has to dominate an area, and that is just not the case here,\\u201d May 7 Tr. at 90:10-16 (Marinelli). 253.\\u2003The United States argued that Santa Clara Pueblo's, San Ildefonso Pueblo's, and Jicarilla Apache Tribe's separate ICC claims also alleged that each Tribe's aboriginal territory either extended into or encompassed the entire Valles Caldera, and that Ferguson's expert report recognizes that Santa Clara Pueblo had grazing lands with the Valles Caldera. See May 7 Tr. at 90:17-91:22 (Marinelli). 254.\\u2003The United States argued that Liebmann wrote an article in which he says that Jicarilla Apache and Navajo Nation members' presence in the Valles Caldera decreased Jemez Pueblo's access to Cerro del Medio obsidian. See May 7 Tr. at 91:23-92:17 (Marinelli). 255.\\u2003The United States argued that \\u201cdominance is a function of population\\u201d and that Jemez Pueblo's population, which, according to the United States, was between 100 and 200 individuals in the 1700s, was too small to dominate any land, particularly while residing in Walatowa twenty to twenty-five miles from the Valles Caldera. May 7 Tr. at 92:17-93:14 (Marinelli). 256.\\u2003The United States argued that eighteen Pueblos presented evidence that they use the Valles Caldera, particularly Redondo Peak, and directed the Court to Santa Clara Pueblo member Jose Lucero's testimony that, without Redondo Peak, Santa Clara Pueblo's four cardinal directions would be incomplete. See May 7 Tr. at 93:15-24 (Marinelli). 257.\\u2003The United States argued that Santa Clara Pueblo and Zia Pueblo opposed the Valles Caldera geothermal development project, because it threatened their ability to use the Valles Caldera, which Ellis contemporaneously chronicled along with many other Pueblos' connection to those lands. See May 7 Tr. at 94:23-96:5 (Marinelli). 258.\\u2003The United States argued that, while serving as Jemez Pueblo's anthropologist, Ellis wrote that the Pueblos of Jemez, Zia, and Santa Ana considered including the Valles Caldera in their ICC claim, but ultimately decided against it, because other Rio Grande Pueblos' connections to those lands would preclude Jemez Pueblos' ability to show either exclusive or dominant use. See May 7 Tr. at 96:5-23 (Marinelli). 259.\\u2003The United States argued that, even if Jemez Pueblo could prove that it is the Valles Caldera's predominate user, which, according to the United States, it cannot, such proof is insufficient to establish aboriginal title, because the standard requires that Jemez Pueblo exercise complete dominion over other Tribes, that is, dominion sufficient to prevent through force other Tribes from using the Valles Caldera, which, according to the United States, Jemez Pueblo could not do given that other Tribes were more numerous than Jemez Pueblo and had unimpeded access to the Valles Caldera. See May 7 Tr. at 97:1-20 (Marinelli). The United States repeated its argument that Jemez Pueblo conceded at trial that other Tribes made the Valles Caldera a dangerous place for Jemez Pueblo, which, according to the United States, undermines Jemez Pueblo' ability to exercise complete dominion. See May 7 Tr. at 97:20-98:3 (Marinelli). 260.\\u2003The United States argued that, throughout history, the Tewa Pueblos, Jemez Pueblo, Jicarilla Apache Nation, and Navajo Nation have had adverse relations that prevented significant interaction, including trade, and at times escalated to open hostilities; for example, the 1863 conflict wherein the Pueblos of Santa Clara and San Ildefonso joined with the United States to recover stolen cattle from Jemez Pueblo and the Navajo Nation, evidences, according to the United States, that other Tribes not only accessed the Valles Caldera without first seeking Jemez Pueblo's permission, but also that other Tribes dominated Jemez Pueblo. See May 7 Tr. at 97:24-99:3 (Marinelli). 261.\\u2003The United States argued that the ceramic, obsidian, geographic, anthropologic, and testimonial evidence all support the United States' position that Tewa and Kewa Pueblos, and other Tribes, used the Valles Caldera regardless whether Jemez Pueblo was opposed to their presence and activities. See May 7 Tr. at 99:3-23 (Marinelli). The United States added that the record does not contain evidence that any Pueblo asked Jemez Pueblo for permission to enter the Valles Caldera, a fact which Jemez Pueblo conceded, according to the United States. See May 7 Tr. at 99:23-100:5 (Marinelli). 262.\\u2003The United States argued that pre-litigation statements from other Pueblos, for example, the Pueblos of San Ildefonso and Santa Clara, indicate that the Pueblos proximate to the Valles Caldera do not believe that the Valles Caldera belongs to Jemez Pueblo, and that such statements are more credible than the recent resolutions that Jemez Pueblo procured for this litigation. See May 7 Tr. at 100:5-101:1 (Marinelli). 263.\\u2003The United States asserted that Jemez Pueblo finds other Pueblos' Redondo Peak use offensive, but, according to the United States, the record establishes that other Pueblos historically used and continue to use Redondo Peak absent Jemez Pueblo's consent or approval. See May 7 Tr. at 101:1-102:13 (Marinelli). 264.\\u2003The United States disputed how Jemez Pueblo characterized Suina's testimony that Cochiti Pueblo supports Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera claim, because, according to the United States, Jemez Pueblo did not disclose to Cochiti Pueblo that Jemez Pueblo objects to Cochiti Pueblo's Redondo Peak use, and such an omission likely affects Cochiti Pueblo's support for Jemez Pueblo in this litigation. See May 7 Tr. at 102:14-103:4 (Marinelli). 265.\\u2003The United States argued that Santa Clara Pueblo distinguishes between its exclusive use boundaries and its joint use boundaries, on which the Court heard extensive evidence from former Santa Clara Pueblo Governor Michael Chavarria, who testified to accessing the Valles Caldera's joint use areas for traditional purposes. See May 7 Tr. at 103:4-17 (Marinelli). 266.\\u2003The United States disputed Jemez Pueblo's assertion that Santa Clara Pueblo does not use the Valles Caldera, because, in addition to Chavarria's testimony, the record includes evidence that Santa Clara Pueblo members snuck into the Valles Caldera during the private ownership period and thereafter received oral permission. See May 7 Tr. at 103:18-104:20 (Marinelli). 267.\\u2003The United States argued that Navajo Nation members historically camped in the Valles Caldera and presently consider it a \\u201cneutral zone\\u201d similar to Anschuetz' Tribal commons conception. May 7 Tr. at 104:25-105:8 (Marinelli). The United States added that Liebmann admitted that Navajo Nation hogans indicate aboriginal occupation. See May 7 Tr. at 105:8-13 (Marinelli). 268.\\u2003The United States restated its position that Jemez Pueblo never had aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera and that the Spanish, through forcible removal and disease, disposed Jemez Pueblo of any land that it may have been using before the Spanish period. See May 7 Tr. at 105:15-106:18 (Marinelli). 269.\\u2003The United States asserted that, in 1992, Jemez Pueblo acknowledged that Spain had disenfranchised Jemez Pueblo when Jemez Pueblo refused to accept a ceremonial cane from a member of the Spanish royal family and instead presented a resolution requesting the return of its land, which, according to the United States, evinces aboriginal title extinguishment and Jemez Pueblo's inability to show continuous use. See May 7 Tr. at 106:25-108:17 (Marinelli). The Court asked why Spanish interference is significant given the Court's understanding that non-Indian interference cannot effect aboriginal title extinguishments, and the United States responded that conquest can extinguish aboriginal title rights and that Spain essentially conquered Jemez Pueblo. See May 7 Tr. at 108:18-109:11 (Court, Marinelli). The United States added that Jemez Pueblo's own witnesses admitted to Jemez Pueblo having lost its interest in the Valles Caldera. See May 7 Tr. at 109:12-110:1 (Marinelli). 270.\\u2003The United States reminded the Court that, in its Oct. 25 MOO, the Court informed the parties that, pursuant to the Tenth Circuit's mandate, the Court must consider evidence of substantial interference with Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use regardless the effect on aboriginal title, and the Court stated that, although it would consider such evidence, so that the Tenth Circuit will having findings in place if it disagrees with the Court's legal analysis, the Court will not find a taking absent substantial interference coupled with Congressional authorization. See May 7 Tr. at 110:2-111:5 (Marinelli, Court). The United States contested the Court's Congressional-authorization requirement and directed the Court to the Tenth Circuit's opinion in this case, which, according to the United States, ties substantial interference to aboriginal title's actual-and-continuous-use requirement for statute-of-limitations purposes before the ICC, which sought to resolve conclusively all pre-1946 claims, and, therefore, the United States' position is that Jemez Pueblo's claim in this case is effectively time-barred, because significant substantial interference occurred well before 1946. See May 7 Tr. at 111:6-113:19 (Marinelli, Court). 271.\\u2003The United States argued that Jemez Pueblo has the burden to establish continuous use, which, according to the United States, Jemez Pueblo admits it cannot prove when it asserts that the early twentieth century restrictions that the Valles Caldera's private owner imposed on hunting, grazing and other uses caused Jemez Pueblo mental, physical, and spiritual suffering such that Jemez Pueblo lost, and has since worked to reestablish, whatever remaining connection it had to those lands. See May 7 Tr. at 115:10-117:25 (Marinelli). The Court expressed that the United States' position regarding substantial interference does not square with the Tenth Circuit's conclusion that the land grant to the Baca heirs was insufficient per se to effect aboriginal title extinguishment, because such a grant would necessarily result in substantial interference, and the United States responded that the Tenth Circuit addressed the Court's concern when it stated that a friendly rancher may permit traditional use, but that here Jemez Pueblo suffered extreme interference with its alleged Valles Caldera uses and so cannot satisfy the Tenth Circuit's standard. See May 7 Tr. at 118:2-120:11 (Court, Marinelli). 272.\\u2003The United States argued that private owners restricted Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera access such that Jemez Pueblo could access Redondo Peak approximately twice per year, which, according to the United States, is neither dominant nor even significant. See May 7 Tr. at 120:12-22 (Marinelli). 273.\\u2003The United States contended that Jemez Pueblo's proposals to Congress to acquire 200 acres on Redondo Peak, to acquire twenty-nine acres on Redondo Peak, and to establish an American Indian seat on the Valles Caldera Trust board are admissions that Jemez Pueblo lacked title to the entire Valles Caldera. See May 7 Tr. at 120:23-121:25 (Marinelli). The United States asserted that Congress not only rejected Jemez Pueblo's proposals but also included language in its legislation that recognizes other Tribes' interests in the Valles Caldera and requires Valles Caldera staff to consult with those Tribes, which the United States argued, is inconsistent with Jemez Pueblo's alleged aboriginal rights. See May 7 Tr. at 122:1-123:7 (Marinelli). 274.\\u2003The United States contested Jemez Pueblo's assertion that the United States is estopped from taking a position inconsistent with the United States' position in United States ex rel. Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana & Zia v. Abousleman, because, first, its positions are not inconsistent given that the claims in United States ex rel. Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana & Zia v. Abousleman do not involve water use within the Valles Caldera, and, second, the estoppel principle is inapplicable while the United States ex rel. Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana & Zia v. Abousleman litigation remains pending. See May 7 Tr. at 123:18-124:14 (Marinelli). The United States argued that estoppel principles apply only to facts, for example, Jemez Pueblo's ICC litigation, which, according to the United States, concluded successfully in Jemez Pueblo's favor and therefore precludes Jemez Pueblo from asserting a position different than the one it took before the ICC, namely, that its aboriginal territory includes the Valles Caldrea. See May 7 Tr. at 124:17-125:6 (Marinelli). 275.\\u2003The United States asserted that the doctrine of laches bars Jemez Pueblo's claims and asked the Court to reconsider its ruling on that issue, because now the Court has a factual record which indicates that the United States' arguments should prevail. See May 7 Tr. at 125:7-14 (Marinelli). 276.\\u2003The United States returned to its argument regarding the Tribal resolutions and added that they do not fall under the rule 803 hearsay exception, because Jemez Pueblo negotiated them in 2016 and, therefore, they did not arise before the controversy. See May 7 Tr. at 125:15-126:8 (Marinelli). Moreover, argued the United States, in 1998 the Pueblos of Santa Clara and San Ildefonso testified before Congress that no single Tribe can assert an exclusive right to the Valles Caldera, and, according to the United States, such statements deserve more weight than statements made after this litigation commenced. See May 7 Tr. at 126:8-18 (Marinelli). 277.\\u2003The United States summarized its expert witnesses' opinion testimony regarding multiple Tribes' Redondo Peak use based on evidence presented in this litigation and before the ICC. See May 7 Tr. at 126:18-127:14 (Marinelli). 278.\\u2003The United States criticized Liebmann's methodology for overcounting Jemez Pueblo Black-on-white pottery and Whatley's methodology for relying exclusively on information from Jemez Pueblo. See May 7 Tr. at 127:14-128:15 (Marinelli). 279.\\u2003The United States' disputed Jemez Pueblo's contention that Anschuetz did not identify with specificity other Tribes' Valles Caldera use, and directed the Court to Anschuetz' interview with Santa Clara Pueblo member Gregory Cajete and others, who, according to the United States, affirmed that the Valles Caldera belongs to all Pueblos and that the Pueblos customarily respect each other's Valles Caldera use. See May 7 Tr. at 128:16-129:21 (Marinelli). 280.\\u2003The Court asked the United States to characterize Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use, see May 7 Tr. at 130:25-1315 (Court), and the United States responded: Jemez farmed in a noncontinuous manner approximately one percent of the land in the southwest corner of the Preserve\\u2024 [I]n modern times we have evidence of certain Jemez societies making certain uses of the Preserve lands, and being prevented from engaging in the vast majority of those uses\\u2024 [T]here is some evidence that at some point Jemez grazed the Preserve lands. But certainly not the evidence that that grazing was continu[ous]. And it was not unique in grazing those lands\\u2024 Santa Clara certainly grazed those lands as well\\u2024 So the United States['] position in this case is not that Jemez has never used the Preserve lands. The United States['] position \\u2024 is many tribes and pueblos have used those [l]ands. Frankly in ways that are quite similar to Jemez\\u2024 [T]here are a multitude of tribes that use this land for a multitude of purposes and there was substantial interference with a lot of that use in the 20th century. May 7 Tr. at 131:10-132:17 (Marinelli). The United States added that Jemez Pueblo's population for at least several hundred years was comparatively smaller than other Pueblos, and too small to dominate the Valles Caldera or to engage more powerful Tribes such as the Jicarilla Apache and Navajo Nation. See May 7 Tr. at 133:3-135:10 (Marinelli). 281.\\u2003The United States summarized the archeological record, and argued that archeological evidence taken as a whole compels the conclusion that Keres, Tewa, and Towa Pueblos, which represent three separate language groups, have used the Valles Caldera since at least the 1200s to gather resources and to practice their respective spiritual traditions. See May 7 Tr. at 135:25-137:19 (Leonard). 282.\\u2003The United States argued that whether Gauthier considered a particular Liebmann report that Jemez Pueblo accuses the United States of ignoring would not have changed Gauthier's conclusions, because the report in question focuses on a portion of the Banco Bonito that is primarily outside the Valles Caldera and is unpersuasive when viewed against the evidence that supports the Valles Caldera as being a commons. See May 7 Tr. at 137:20-138:15 (Leonard). 283.\\u2003The United States discussed the Valles Caldera ceramic sherd collection and argued that most Jemez Pueblo sherds are located on the Banco Bonito, which represents a small portion of the Valles Caldera and which Jemez Pueblo farmed seasonally for a relatively brief time period that ceased in 1650 C.E. See May 7 Tr. at 138:17-137:14 (Leonard). In contrast, the United States contended, the Valles Caldera contains far more numerous Keres and Tewa sites that were in use between 1200 C.E. and at least 1750 C.E., several of which are also located on or near the Banco Bonito, thereby defeating Jemez Pueblo's exclusive use arguments. See May 7 Tr. at 139:14-141:14 (Leonard). The United States repeated its argument that no Tribe ever sought Jemez Pueblo's permission to access the Valles Caldera. See May 7 Tr. at 141:14-25 (Leonard). 284.\\u2003The United States disputed Jemez Pueblo's argument that non-Jemez Pueblo pottery found in the Valles Caldera could have resulted from trade, because, according to the United States, much of the pottery predates the Pueblo Revolt, before which Towa and Tewa Pueblos did not exchange pottery. See May 7 Tr. at 142:25-143:8 (Leonard). The Court asked the United States whether the United States is asking the Court to make a finding that trade did not occur, and the United States responded that the record not only supports such a finding but also the additional finding that relations among Tribes were not close. See May 7 Tr. at 143:9-143:25 (Leonard). 285.\\u2003The United States suggested that Tribes may have traded Valles Rhyolite obsidian, because researchers have found such obsidian as far away as Oklahoma, Kansas, and North Dakota, or merely collected the obsidian themselves. See May 7 Tr. at 144:5-145:1 (Leonard). 286.\\u2003The United States argued that the Court of Claims in Zuni Tribe of New Mexico v. United States\\u2009 relied in part on pottery sherd evidence similar to the evidence in this case to conclude that Zuni people continuously used the land at issue. See May 7 Tr. at 145:9-146:6 (Leonard). 287.\\u2003The United States argued that Gauthier's methodology, wherein Gauthier first determined a sherd's cultural affiliation and then considered whether archeologists found the sherd at a known site before determining the site's cultural affiliation based on the sherd, is more scientific than Liebmann's methodology, which permits Liebmann to conclude that Jemez Pueblo was the Valles Caldera's dominant user, because the Valles Caldera ceramics collection is mostly Jemez Pueblo pottery yet disregards that archeologists found most Jemez Pueblo pottery on the Banco Bonito, of which archeologists have surveyed ninety-five percent as compared to a mere thirty-one percent of the Valles Caldera's remaining areas where Keres and Tewa sherds dominate, and thereby defeats Jemez Pueblo's claim to exclusive use. See May 7 Tr. at 146:7-148:14 (Leonard). 288.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo informed the Court that it has arranged its findings of fact so that the Court can consider whether Jemez Pueblo has aboriginal title to discrete areas within the Valles Caldera if the Court is disinclined to conclude that Jemez Pueblo has aboriginal title to the entire area at issue. See May 7 Tr. at 150:11-19 (West). 289.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argued that, to defeat Jemez Pueblo's exclusive use arguments, the Court needs specific evidence regarding other Tribes' uses, of which, according to Jemez Pueblo, for many areas within the Valles Caldera there is none. See May 7 Tr. at 150:19-25 (West). 290.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argued that the Court must consider the time period that certain evidence in this case depicts; for example, Anschuetz' map depicts straight line travel to Cerro del Medio from Pueblos established after Spanish arrival and thereby disregards that some Jemez Pueblo villages were much closer to Cerro del Medio in the pre-Spanish period. See May 7 Tr. at 151:1-23 (West). 291.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo disputed the United States' assertion that Liebmann did not consider Kulisheck's work, that Liebmann conceded that Jemez Pueblo abandoned its Banco Bonito fieldhouses, and that Liebmann admitted that other Pueblos used Cerro del Medio obsidian more than Jemez Pueblo. See May 7 Tr. at 151:1-154:23 (West). 292.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo disputed the United States' assertion that Jemez Pueblo's population was too small to dominate the Valles Caldera, because Jemez Pueblo's expert witnesses testified that Jemez Pueblo's population, although reduced during the Spanish and Mexican period, was nevertheless sustainable and sufficient to control the Valles Caldera. See May 7 Tr. at 154:9-25 (West). Jemez Pueblo added that Garc\\u00eda y Griego testified specifically that Jemez Pueblo's population decreased because of epidemic and not hostility, and that Jemez Pueblo maintained the military capability to defend the Valles Caldera throughout the relevant period. See May 7 Tr. at 154:25-156:3 (West). 293.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argued that its historic hostilities with other Tribes, for example, the Navajo Nation, do not defeat exclusivity, because, according to Jemez Pueblo, both the Court in this case and the ICC have concluded that unsuccessful raids, temporary encroachments, and mere wandering across land cannot extinguish aboriginal title absent actual, sustained use. See May 7 Tr. at 156:4-21 (West). 294.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo disputed how the United States characterized Ellis' work, because, although Ellis discussed other Tribes using the Redondo Peak shrine, she labeled it a \\u201cJemez shrine,\\u201d and, moreover, she created her work for a joint ICC claim that did not involve the Valles Caldera and did not include any findings of fact that could support the United States' judicial estoppel arguments. May 7 Tr. at 157:3-158:7 (West). Jemez Pueblo added that Ellis' work is almost sixty years old, is inconsistent, and does not consider new evidence such as the present ceramics and obsidian records. See May 7 Tr. at 158:8-21 (West). 295.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argued that the United States is largely speculating as to other Tribes' Valles Caldera use and is too reliant on Anschuetz' interviews, which, according to Jemez Pueblo, lack specificity, particularly his interviews with Santa Clara Pueblo and Zia Pueblo members. See May 7 Tr. at 158:22-160:12 (West). 296.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo urged the Court to read Kelley's expert report, because, according to Jemez Pueblo, Kelley concludes that the Navajo Nation does not consider Redondo Peak a sacred mountain and did not assert before the ICC that its aboriginal territory includes any part of the Valles Caldera, which it used infrequently while raiding other Tribes' livestock. See May 7 Tr. at 160:13-161:7 (West). 297.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo asked the Court to discredit the United States' arguments about the Jicarilla Apache's and San Ildefonso's claims before the ICC, because Jicarilla Apache's claim was unsuccessful and because San Ildefonso did not claim land within the Valles Caldera's present boundaries. See May 7 Tr. at 161:8-20 (West). 298.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo criticized the United States for asserting that Dunigan granted Jemez Pueblo Valles Caldera access on only three occasions, because, according to Jemez Pueblo, Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use was well-known within the Dunigan family and Dunigan relied heavily on managers who had permission to grant access absent Dunigan's knowledge. See May 7 Tr. at 161:21-162:6 (West). 299.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argued that the United States confused which party has the burden of proof regarding extinguishment when the United States discussed Jemez Pueblo's proposals to Congress in 2000 and 2014. See May 7 Tr. at 162:7-17 (West). 300.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argued that its judicial estoppel argument in United States ex rel. Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana & Zia v. Abousleman does not turn on water rights, but instead is specific to the United States' position in that case that Spain did not extinguish Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title. See May 7 Tr. at 162:18-163:2 (West). 301.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argued that the Court admitted the Tribal resolutions pursuant to the Federal Rules of Evidence's provisions for government records and for reputation regarding boundaries. See May 7 Tr. at 163:2-6 (West). 302.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo argued that the United States relies heavily on ceramics collected from [Redacted] to support its conclusion that multiple Tribes used the Valles Caldera, but ignores the evidence which suggests that Tribes occupied that site during two separate time periods, the earlier of which Jemez Pueblo ceramics are present exclusively while the latter also includes significant Jemez Pueblo representation. See May 7 Tr. at 163:11-166:2 (West). 303.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo disputed the United States' contention that the ceramics record as to Jemez Pueblo is limited to the Banco Bonito and identified numerous unassigned sites in the Valles Caldera's northeast corner which could have belonged to Jemez Pueblo. See May 7 Tr. at 166:2-23 (West). 304.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo concluded by arguing that Liebmann's obsidian research augments his ceramics studies and shows that Jemez Pueblo used the Valles Caldera through the seventeenth century. See May 7 Tr. at 167:7-17 (West). LAW REGARDING SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY 305.\\u2003\\u201cThe United States cannot be sued without its consent.\\u201d Garcia v. United States, 709 F.

Nordic Vill., Inc., 503 U.S. 30, 33-34, 112 S.Ct. 1011, 117 L.Ed.2d 181 (1992); United States v. Mitchell, 445 U.S. 535, 538, 100 S.Ct. 1349, 63 L.Ed.2d 607 (1980); United States v. Murdock Mach. & Eng'g Co. of Utah, 81 F.3d 922, 930 (10th Cir. 1996). The United States' agencies also have sovereign immunity absent a waiver. See FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. at 475, 114 S.Ct. 996 (\\u201cAbsent a waiver, sovereign immunity shields the Federal Government and its agencies from suit.\\u201d). 2.\\u200328 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1346(a)(2). 307.\\u2003Section 1346(a)(2) provides: (a)\\u2003The district courts shall have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the United States Court of Federal Claims, of: \\u2024 (2)\\u2003Any other civil action or claim against the United States, not exceeding $10,000 in amount, founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress, or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort, except that the district courts shall not have jurisdiction of any civil action or claim against the United States founded upon any express or implied contract with the United States or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort which are subject to sections 7104(b)(1) and 7107(a)(1) of title 41. 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1346(a)(2).

United States, 661 F.2d 826, 830-31 (10th Cir. 1981). See McKay v.

Section 2409a provides in relevant part: The United States may be named as a party defendant in a civil action under this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an interest, other than a security interest or water rights. This section does not apply to trust or restricted Indian lands \\u2024 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2409a(a). These statutes, together referred to as the QTA, provide subject-matter jurisdiction and a waiver of sovereign immunity for quiet-title actions against the United States. See Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 132 S.

Such action shall be deemed to have accrued on the date the plaintiff or his predecessor in interest knew or should have known of the claim of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2409a(g).

A plaintiff's claim being timely under this statute of limitations is a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2409a. See Block v. North Dakota, 461 U.S. at 287, 103 S.Ct. 1811 (\\u201cWhen waiver legislation contains a statute of limitations, the limitations provision constitutes a condition on the waiver of sovereign immunity.\\u201d); Rio Grande Silvery Minnow (Hybognathus amarus) v.

The Tenth Circuit has \\u201cheld that for purposes of determining when \\u2018the claim\\u2019 accrues under \\u00a7 2409a(f), \\u2018[a]ll that is necessary is a reasonable awareness that the government claims some interest adverse to the plaintiffs.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Vincent Murphy Chevrolet Co., Inc. v.

All that is necessary is a reasonable awareness that the Government claims some interest adverse to the plaintiff's.\\u201d Rio Grande Silvery Minnow (Hybognathus amarus) v. Bureau of Reclamation, 599 F.3d at 1176 (emphasis in original). 312.\\u2003Furthermore, \\u201cthe United States need not assert a full legal title in the disputed property for the limitations period to accrue; the claimed adverse interest in the title of the property merely must be substantial enough to create a cloud on title.\\u201d Rio Grande Silvery Minnow (Hybognathus amarus) v. Bureau of Reclamation, 599 F.3d at 1176. The Tenth Circuit has held that the knowledge of deed restrictions in place that benefitted the United States was sufficient to trigger the running of the statute of limitations under 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2409a(f). See Vincent Murphy Chevrolet Co., Inc. v. United States, 766 F.2d at 452 (\\u201cAppellants concede knowledge of a \\u2018claim\\u2019 -- the deed restrictions -- as early as 1965. This is all that is necessary under \\u00a7 2409a(f).\\u201d). The Tenth Circuit elaborated: While the Supreme Court in Block [v. North Dakota, 461 U.S. 273, 287, 103 S.Ct. 1811, 75 L.Ed.2d 840] indicated that the statutes waiving immunity should not be construed in an unduly restrictive manner, it cautioned that these statutes could not be interpreted in such a manner as to \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018extend the waiver beyond that which Congress intended.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Block v. North Dakota, 461 U.S. at 287, 103 S.Ct. at 1820. To hold that the twelve-year statute of limitations did not begin to run until conditions began changing would give rise to an interpretation of the term \\u201cclaim\\u201d under \\u00a7 2409a(f) which could extend the limitations period indefinitely. We cannot extend the waiver of immunity under the quiet title act beyond that which Congress could have intended and we refuse to do so without a clear expression of legislative intent. See Stubbs v. United States, 620 F.2d at 780-81 (where this court found that \\u201c[C]ongress was reluctant \\u2024 to open up stale claims to litigation\\u201d). Appellants argue that in the twelve-year period following 1965, they would not have had a cause of action to quiet title since there would have been no justiciable controversy as the cause of action could not have accrued until conditions began changing. While such argument evokes empathy, we do not believe that it comports with the limited waiver of sovereign immunity Congress intended, and in construing the statute of limitations strictly as a condition to the waiver of sovereign immunity, we must reject appellants' argument. Vincent Murphy Chevrolet Co., Inc. v. United States, 766 F.2d at 452. 313.\\u2003Although 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2409a contains a sovereign immunity waiver, it is limited to title claims that do not involve \\u201ctrust or restricted Indian lands.\\u201d 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2409a(a). Thus, the Act's waiver of sovereign immunity is qualified by an exception for suits challenging title to lands held in trust for Indian tribes: \\u201cwhen the United States claims an interest in real property based on that property's status as trust or restricted Indian lands, the Quiet Title Act does not waive the Government's immunity.\\u201d Governor of Kan. v. Kempthorne, 516 F.3d 833, 841 (10th Cir. 2008)(quoting Neighbors for Rational Dev., Inc. v. Norton, 379 F.3d 956, 961 (10th Cir. 2004)). 314.\\u2003The Supreme Court has emphasized the Indian-land exception's importance: \\u201cIf we were to allow claimants to try the Federal Government's title to land under an officer's-suit[] theory, the Indian land exception to the QTA would be rendered nugatory.\\u201d Block v. North Dakota, 461 U.S. at 285, 103 S.Ct. 1811. Thus, \\u201cwhen the United States claims an interest in real property based on that property's status as trust or restricted Indian lands, the Quiet Title Act does not waive the government's immunity.\\u201d United States v. Mottaz, 476 U.S. at 843, 106 S.Ct. 2224. See Wildman v. United States, 827 F.2d 1306, 1309 (9th Cir. 1987)(\\u201cThe ordinary reason[s] for enforcing sovereign immunity \\u2024 are reinforced when Indian lands are in question.\\u201d). \\u201cAs long as the United States has a \\u2018colorable claim\\u2019 to a property interest based on that property's status as trust or restricted Indian lands, the QTA renders the government immune from suit.\\u201d State of Alaska v. Babbitt, 75 F.3d 449, 451-52 (9th Cir. 1996). 315.\\u2003\\u201cBecause \\u00a7 2409a limits the sovereign immunity of the United States, it must be interpreted according to federal law.\\u201d Rio Grande Silvery Minnow (Hybognathus amarus) v. Bureau of Reclamation, 599 F.3d at 1177. \\u201cHowever, federal courts may properly look to state law as an aid in determining the application of statutory language to specific facts.\\u201d Rio Grande Silvery Minnow (Hybognathus amarus) v. Bureau of Reclamation, 599 F.3d at 1177. \\u201cIn particular, \\u2018questions involving ownership, transfer and title to real estate have traditionally been resolved according to the laws of the state where the realty is located.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Rio Grande Silvery Minnow (Hybognathus amarus) v.

LAW REGARDING RULE 19 316.\\u2003Parties meeting the criteria laid out in rule 19(a)(1) are required parties. If a required party is not joined, then \\u201cthe court must order that the person be made a party.\\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(2). If the required party cannot be joined, then a court must consider the factors in rule 19(b) to determine whether it should dismiss the case or should allow the case to proceed with the existing parties. 317.\\u2003Earlier caselaw generally describes those parties who should be joined under rule 19(a) as necessary parties, and those necessary parties whose absence requires that a case be dismissed under rule 19(b) as indispensable parties, or necessary and indispensable parties. The 2007 amendments to the rules changed the term \\u201cnecessary parties\\u201d to \\u201crequired parties.\\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 19. These amendments were stylistic only, however, and much of the caselaw interpreting rule 19 predates the amendments, and refers to necessary and indispensable parties. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 19 advisory committee's notes 2007; Hernandez v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 347 F. Supp. 3d 921, 961 (D.N.M. 2018)(Browning, J.). 1.\\u2003Incomplete Relief. 318.\\u2003One basis on which a party may be a required or necessary party is if, \\u201cin that person's absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties.\\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1)(A). A court is able to afford complete relief when a party's absence \\u201cdoes not prevent the plaintiffs from receiving their requested \\u2024 relief.\\u201d Sac & Fox Nation of Missouri v. Norton, 240 F.3d at 1258 (10th Cir. 2001). As Moore's Federal Practice explains, this provision \\u201crequires joinder when nonjoinder precludes the court from effecting relief not in some overall sense, but between extant parties.\\u201d 4 J. Moore & R. Freer, Moore's Federal Practice \\u00a7 19.03[2][b], at 19-39 (3d ed. 2009)(emphasis in original). \\u201cProperly interpreted, the Rule is not invoked simply because some absentee may cause future litigation\\u2024 The fact that the absentee might later frustrate the outcome of the litigation does not by itself make the absentee necessary for complete relief.\\u201d 4 Moore's Federal Practice \\u00a7 19.03[2][b], at 19-39 to 19-41 (footnotes omitted). 319.\\u2003Those cases discussing rule 19(a)'s complete-relief segment look at whether a plaintiff or other claimant can be granted complete relief without adding parties. For example, in Salt Lake Tribune Pub. Co., LLC v. AT & T Corp., 320 F.3d 1081 (10th Cir. 2003), the Tenth Circuit analyzed whether the district court could grant the plaintiff all the relief that it was seeking on its claims. See 320 F.3d at 1097. In Associated Dry Goods Corp. v. Towers Financial Corp., 920 F.2d 1121 (2d Cir. 1990), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that an absent party was a necessary party to afford a counterclaimant complete relief because the counter-defendant could not comply with the injunction that the counterclaimant sought without the consent of the absent party. See 920 F.2d at 1124. In Champagne v. City of Kansas City, 157 F.R.D. 66 (D. Kan. 1994)(Lungstrum, J.), a number of paramedics filed suit against the City of Kansas City, alleging overtime-pay violations. See 157 F.R.D. at 67. The City sought to join as plaintiffs other paramedics who had not sued. See 157 F.R.D. at 67. The Honorable John W. Lungstrum, Senior United States District Judge for the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, held: Complete relief refers to relief as between the persons already parties to the action and not as between a present party and the absent party whose joinder is sought. The named plaintiffs in the present action would be able to obtain all the relief requested without the joinder of four additional paramedics. Defendant's assertion that all persons whose claims are identical to the plaintiffs should be joined is not within the meaning of complete relief. 157 F.R.D. at 67 (citation omitted). See Hernandez v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 347 F. Supp. 3d at 961. 2.\\u2003Inconsistent Obligations. 320.\\u2003Another way in which a party can be a required or necessary party is if the \\u201cperson claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person's absence may \\u2024 leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.\\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1)(B)(ii). This clause \\u201ccompels joinder of an absentee to avoid inconsistent obligations, and not to avoid inconsistent adjudications. It is not triggered by the possibility of a subsequent adjudication that may result in a judgment that is inconsistent as a matter of logic.\\u201d 4 Moore's Federal Practice \\u00a7 19.03[4][d], at 19-59 to 19-60 (emphasis in original)(footnotes omitted). This understanding is reflected in the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit's description of the rule: \\u201cInconsistent obligations\\u201d are not \\u2024 the same as inconsistent adjudications or results. Inconsistent obligations occur when a party is unable to comply with one court's order without breaching another court's order concerning the same incident. Inconsistent adjudications or results, by contrast, occur when a defendant successfully defends a claim in one forum, yet loses on another claim arising from the same incident in another forum. Unlike a risk of inconsistent obligations, a risk that a defendant who has successfully defended against a party may be found liable to another party in a subsequent action arising from the same incident -- i.e., a risk of inconsistent adjudications or results-does not necessitate joinder of all of the parties into one action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a). Delgado v. Plaza Las Americas, Inc., 139 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1998)(citations omitted). 321.\\u2003The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has adopted the First Circuit's approach to rule 19(a)(1)(B)(ii). See Cachil Dehe Band of Wintun Indians of the Colusa Indian Community v. California, 547 F.3d 962, 976 (9th Cir. 2008)(\\u201cCachil\\u201d). Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit held that there was no risk of inconsistent obligations in a situation in which the State of California might have to adhere to one interpretation of a compact when dealing with particular Indian Tribes, while following a different interpretation in its dealings with other Tribes, because California could consistently deal with each Tribe according to the different judgments. See Cachil, 547 F.3d at 976. Other Courts of Appeals, as well as lower courts and leading treatises, have all taken the same approach. See, e.g., Boone v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 682 F.2d 552, 554 (5th Cir. 1982)(holding that, where \\u201cmultiple litigation might result \\u2024 [but there is] little possibility of inconsistent obligations,\\u201d rule 19(a) is not implicated); Field v. Volkswagenwerk AG, 626 F.2d 293, 301 (3d Cir. 1980); Fisherman's Harvest, Inc. v. United States, 74 Fed. Cl. 681, 688-89 (Fed. Cl. 2006); 4 Moore's Federal Practice \\u00a7 19.03[4][d], at 19-59 to 19-61 (stating that inconsistent obligations occur only when a party cannot obey two conflicting order from different courts). While the Tenth Circuit has not devoted extended discussion to inconsistent obligations, it has given, as an example of inconsistent obligations, a hypothetical scenario in which a federal district court orders a defendant to transfer stock to the plaintiff while a state court orders the same defendant to transfer the same stock to a different party who is not involved in the federal litigation. See Salt Lake Tribune Pub. Co., LLC v. AT & T Corp., 320 F.3d at 1098. LAW REGARDING EXPERT TESTIMONY 322.\\u2003\\u201cSince the Supreme Court of the United States decided [Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993)(\\u201cDaubert\\u201d)\\u2009], trial courts have had the responsibility to make certain that proffered experts will assist the jury in understanding the evidence and in determining the factual issues it must decide.\\u201d United States v. Gutierrez-Castro, 805 F. Supp. 2d 1218, 1224 (D.N.M. 2011)(Browning, J.). \\u201cThe Court now must not only decide whether the expert is qualified to testify, but, under Daubert, whether the opinion testimony is the product of a reliable methodology.\\u201d United States v.

Fed. R. Evid. 702. Rule 702 thus requires the trial court to \\u201cdetermine whether the expert is proposing to testify to (1) scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge that (2) will assist the trier of fact to understand or determine a fact in issue.\\u201d United States v. Muldrow, 19 F.3d 1332, 1337 (10th Cir. 1994). Rule 702 uses a liberal definition of \\u201cexpert.\\u201d Fed. R.

An expert is \\u201crequired to possess such skill, experience or knowledge in that particular field as to make it appear that his opinion would rest on substantial foundation and would tend to aid the trier of fact in his search for truth.\\u201d LifeWise Master Funding v. Telebank, 374 F.3d 917, 928 (10th Cir. 2004). In United States v. Goxcon-Chagal, 886 F. Supp. 2d 1222, 1239 (D.N.M. 2012)(Browning, J.), the Court identified as relevant, and admitted, testimony on: (ii) the likelihood that a drug organization would entrust individuals outside of the organization with a large amount of drugs; (iii) the significance of the presence of multiple cellular telephones in the vehicle; (iv) the significance of the possession of multiple license plates; (v) the separation of individuals who package drugs and individuals who are drug couriers within a drug organization; (vi) the significance of the presence of multiple air fresheners in the vehicle; and (vii) the significance of the presence of a firearm in the vehicle. 886 Supp. 2d at 1239. The Court did not admit testimony on whether a highway portion was a \\u201cdrug route,\\u201d because the \\u201cproposed testimony is too close to characterizing \\u2018nearly any trip down the interstate\\u2019 as traveling in a known drug route.\\u201d United States v.

See Daubert, 509 U.S. at 594-95, 113 S.Ct. 2786; Witherspoon v. Navajo Ref. Co., No. 03-1160, 2005 WL 5988649, at *2 (D.N.M. July 18, 2005)(Black, J.)(citing Dodge v. Cotter Corp., 328 F.3d 1212, 1221 (10th Cir. 2003)). The Supreme Court articulated a non-exclusive list of factors that weigh into a district court's first-step reliability determination, including: (i) whether the method has been tested; (ii) whether the method has been published and subject to peer review; (iii) the error rate; (iv) the existence of standards and whether the witness applied them in the present case; and (v) whether the witness' method is generally accepted as reliable in the relevant medical and scientific community. See Daubert, 509 U.S. at 594-95, 113 S.Ct. 2786. The district court is also to consider whether the witness' conclusion represents an \\u201cunfounded extrapolation\\u201d from the data; whether the witness has adequately accounted for alternative explanations for the effect at issue; whether the opinion was reached for the purposes of litigation or as the result of independent studies; or whether it unduly relies on anecdotal evidence. See Witherspoon v. Navajo Ref. Co., 2005 WL 5988649, at *3 (citing Gen. Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 146, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997)). The Tenth Circuit stated the applicable standard in Norris v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 397 F.3d 878 (10th Cir. 2005): Rule 702 requires the district court to \\u201censure that any and all scientific testimony or evidence is not only relevant, but reliable.\\u201d Bitler v. A.O. Smith Corp., 391 F.3d 1114, 1120 (10th Cir. 2004)(quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 589, 113 S.Ct. 2786 \\u2024). This obligation involves a two-part inquiry. Id. \\u201c[A] district court must [first] determine if the expert's proffered testimony \\u2024 has \\u2018a reliable basis in the knowledge and experience of his [or her] discipline.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Id. (quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592, 113 S.Ct. 2786 \\u2024). In making this determination, the district court must decide \\u201cwhether the reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony is scientifically valid\\u2024\\u201d Id. (quoting Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592-93, 113 S.Ct. 2786 \\u2024). Second, the district court must further inquire into whether proposed testimony is sufficiently \\u201crelevant to the task at hand.\\u201d Daubert, 509 U.S. at 597, 113 S.Ct. 2786 \\u2024 397 F.3d at 883-84 (footnote omitted). \\u201cThe second inquiry is related to the first. Under the relevance prong of the Daubert analysis, the court must ensure that the proposed expert testimony logically advances a material aspect of the case\\u2024 The evidence must have a valid scientific connection to the disputed facts in the case.\\u201d Norris v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 397 F.3d at 884 n.2 (citing Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc., 43 F.3d 1311, 1315 (9th Cir. 1995)(on remand from the Supreme Court)); Daubert, 509 U.S. at 591, 113 S.Ct. 2786). If the expert's proffered testimony fails on the first prong, the court does not reach the second prong. See Norris v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 397 F.3d at 884. In Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999), the Supreme Court expanded the rules under Daubert to non-scientific expert testimony. See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. at 141, 119 S.Ct. 1167 (\\u201cWe conclude that Daubert's general holding -- setting forth the trial judge's general \\u2018gatekeeping\\u2019 obligation -- applies not only to testimony based on \\u2018scientific\\u2019 knowledge, but also to testimony based on \\u2018technical\\u2019 and \\u2018other specialized\\u2019 knowledge.\\u201d) (quoting Carmichael v. Samyang Tires, Inc., 923 F. Supp. 1514, 1521 (S.D. Ala. 1996)). The Supreme Court recognized in Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael that the factors from Daubert will not apply to all cases: Our emphasis on the word \\u201cmay\\u201d thus reflects Daubert's description of the Rule 702 inquiry as a flexible one. Daubert makes clear that the factors it mentions do not constitute a definitive checklist or test. And Daubert adds that the gatekeeping inquiry must be tied to the facts of a particular case. Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. at 150, 119 S.Ct. 1167 (internal quotation marks omitted). 326.\\u2003In conducting its review under Daubert, a court must focus generally on \\u201cprinciples and methodologies, and not on the conclusions generated.\\u201d Armeanu v. Bridgestone/Firestone N. Am., Tire, LLC, No. CIV 05-0619, 2006 WL 4060665, at *11 (D.N.M. Sept. 26, 2006)(Browning, J.)(citing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 595, 113 S.Ct. 2786). \\u201cDespite this focus on methodology, an expert's conclusions are not immune from scrutiny \\u2024 and the court may conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered.\\u201d Armeanu v. Bridgestone/Firestone N. Am., Tire, LLC, 2006 WL 4060665, at *11 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)(quoting Dodge v. Cotter Corp., 328 F.3d at 1222). The proponent of the expert's opinion testimony bears the burden of establishing that the expert is qualified, that the methodology which he or she uses to support his or her opinions is reliable, and that his or her opinion fits the facts of the case and thus will be helpful to the jury. See Norris v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 397 F.3d at 881. The Tenth Circuit noted in Hollander v. Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp., 289 F.3d 1193 (10th Cir. 2002): Because the district court has discretion to consider a variety of factors in assessing reliability under Daubert, and because, in light of that discretion, there is not an extensive body of appellate case law defining the criteria for assessing scientific reliability, we are limited to determining whether the district court's application of the Daubert manifests a clear error of judgment or exceeds the bounds of permissible choice in the circumstances\\u2024 Thus, when coupled with this deferential standard of review, Daubert's effort to safeguard the reliability of science in the courtroom may produce a counter-intuitive effect: different courts relying on the essentially the same science may reach different results. 289 F.3d at 1206. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit noted in Claar v. Burlington Northern Railroad, 29 F.3d 499 (9th Cir. 1994): Coming to a firm conclusion first and then doing research to support it is the antithesis of this method. Certainly, scientists may form initial tentative hypotheses. However, scientists whose conviction about the ultimate conclusion of their research is so firm that they are willing to aver under oath that it is correct prior to performing the necessary validating tests could properly be viewed by the district court as lacking the objectivity that is the hallmark of the scientific method. 29 F.3d at 502-03. Once reliability is established, however, it is still within the district court's discretion to determine whether expert testimony will be helpful to the trier of fact. In making that determination, the court should consider, among other factors, the testimony's relevance, the jurors' common knowledge and experience, and whether the expert's testimony may usurp the jury's primary role as the evaluator of evidence. Ram v. N.M. Dep't of Env't, No. CIV 05-1083, 2006 WL 4079623, at *10 (D.N.M. Dec. 15, 2006)(Browning, J.)(citing United States v. Rodriguez-Felix, 450 F.3d 1117, 1123 (10th Cir. 2006)). 327.\\u2003An untested hypothesis does not provide a scientific basis to support an expert opinion. See Norris v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 397 F.3d at 887 (\\u201c[A]t best, silicone-associated connective tissue disease is an untested hypothesis. At worst, the link has been tested and found to be untenable.

See Att'y Gen. of Okla. v. Tyson Foods, Inc., 565 F.3d at 780 (\\u201cThe case law indicates that the courts are not unfamiliar with the PCR methodology,[] and in fact some courts have indicated their acceptance of it.\\u201d).

Sept. 21, 2011)(Browning, J.)(citing Fed. R. Evid. 802). Rule 801(c) of the Federal Rules of Evidence defines hearsay: \\u201ca statement that: (1) the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing; and (2) a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.\\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). Courts deem hearsay generally unreliable and untrustworthy. See Chambers v.

Pelullo, 964 F.2d 193, 203 (3rd Cir. 1992)). Testimonial proof is necessarily based upon the human senses, which can be unreliable.

See Weinstein's Federal Evidence \\u00a7 802.02[2][a], at 802-5. Courts view hearsay evidence as unreliable because it is not subject to an oath, personal presence in court, or cross examination, see, e.g., United States v. Console, 13 F.3d at 656; it is difficult to evaluate the credibility of out-of-court statements when the three safeguards mentioned above are unavailable, see Weinstein's Federal Evidence \\u00a7 802.02[3], at 802-6 to -7. 331.\\u2003\\u201cHearsay within hearsay\\u201d is admissible only \\u201cif each part of the combined statements conforms with an exception to the rule.\\u201d Fed.

Cardascia, 951 F.2d 474, 488 (2d Cir. 1991))(internal quotation marks omitted). This requirement is not to say that the statement must be said at the very moment of the incident, but for intent to be proved, it must be \\u201ccontemporaneous\\u201d to the act. Mutual Life Ins.

In addition to the requirements that the statement be contemporaneous to the incident at hand and relevant to the case's issues, it must also be established that there was no opportunity for the declarant to \\u201cfabricate or to misrepresent his thoughts.\\u201d United States v. Jackson, 780 F.2d 1305, 1315 (7th Cir. 1986). The intent statements must reveal information or details about the future, which has been contrasted with memory statements or looking back to the past. See Shepard v. United States, 290 U.S. 96, 104, 54 S.Ct. 22, 78 L.Ed. 196 (1933). When statements entail issues of looking into the past combined with other concerns, it can often be too confusing for a jury to extract, upsetting the balance of advantage, and ultimately making the evidence inadmissible. See Shepard v. United States, 290 U.S. at 104, 54 S.Ct. 22. \\u201cThe most obvious risk of prejudice is that the jury will consider the hearsay statement not as proof of state of mind and the subsequent conduct of the declarant, but rather for the truth of the facts that are related in the statement.\\u201d Stephen A.

R. Evid. 803(19). As the Advisory Committee Note highlights, rule 803(19) is concerned with matters of personal and family history. Marriage is universally conceded to be a proper subject of proof by evidence of reputation in the community. 5 Wigmore \\u00a7 1602. As to such items as legitimacy, relationship, adoption, birth, and death, the decisions are divided. Id. \\u00a7 1605. All seem to be susceptible to being the subject of well founded repute. The \\u201cworld\\u201d in which the reputation may exist may be family, associates, or community. This world has proved capable of expanding with changing times from the single uncomplicated neighborhood, in which all activities take place, to the multiple and unrelated worlds of work, religious affiliation, and social activity, in each of which a reputation may be generated. People v. Reeves, 360 Ill. 55, 195 N.E. 443 (1935); State v. Axilrod, 248 Minn. 204, 79 N.W.2d 677 (1956); Mass. Stat. 1947, c. 410, M.G.L.A. c. 233 \\u00a7 21A; 5 Wigmore \\u00a7 1616. The family has often served as the point of beginning for allowing community reputation. 5 Wigmore \\u00a7 1488. Fed. R. Evid. 803 advisory committee's note. Weinstein's Federal Evidence further articulates the need for this exception: Other evidence of family matters is frequently unavailable, and it is likely that these matters have been sufficiently inquired about and discussed with persons who have personal knowledge so that a trustworthy consensus has been reached. No requirement of unavailability is imposed, because of the likelihood that on questions of this kind -- such as birth, adoption, and legitimacy -- other available witnesses would also be testifying from reputation, rather than personal knowledge\\u2024 The rule does not require that reputation in question have been formulated before the controversy arose, since a false reputation as to birth, death, or marriage is not likely to arise at any time. However, there is a greater possibility of inaccuracy concerning other aspects of family history, such as an ancestor's travels. 5 Jack B. Weinstein & Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein's Federal Evidence, \\u00a7 803.21[2] at 803-140 (Mark S. Brodin ed., 2d ed. 2018). 335.\\u2003Rule 803(19) provides that reputation evidence is admissible to prove personal or family history, and that family members or close associates can establish the reputation. See Fed. R. Evid. 803(19); Saltzburg, supra, at 803-93. Reputation in the community often serves to provide evidence of marriage. See 5 Wigmore on Evidence \\u00a7 1602, at 569 (Chadbourn rev. 1974)(\\u201c[I]t has been universally conceded that reputation in the community is always admissible to evidence the fact of marriage; there does not seem to have been any time when this was disputed.\\u201d). The Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules notes that this exception contemplates, as proper subjects of proof, marriage, legitimacy, relationship, adoption, birth, and death. See Fed. R. Evid. 803(19) advisory committee's notes. See United States v. Jean-Baptiste, 166 F.3d 102, 110 (2d Cir. 1999)(\\u201c[Rule 803(19)] plainly contemplates that members of a family may testify with regard to the common understanding as to the birth of another family member.\\u201d). No matter the purpose, reputation testimony requires a reliable foundation. See Blackburn v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 179 F.3d 81, 100-01 (3d Cir. 1999)(concluding that, to admit reputation evidence among a work community, the proponent must establish that reputation testimony \\u201carises from sufficient inquiry and discussion among persons with personal knowledge of the matter\\u201d to constitute trustworthy reputation; rumors and speculation are insufficient). The exception's rationale \\u201cis that \\u2018the natural effusions of those who talk over family affairs \\u2024 are trustworthy.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Saltzburg, supra, at 803-93 (quoting Johnson v. State, 737 S.W.2d 901, 905 (Tex. App. 1987), aff'd in part and vacated on other grounds in part, 784 S.W.2d 47 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990)(en banc)(construing the state counterpart to Federal Rule 803(19))). 3.\\u2003Rule 803(20). 336.\\u2003Under the rule 803(20) hearsay exception, an out-of-court statement is admissible if the statement concerns \\u201creputation in a community -- arising before the controversy -- concerning boundaries of land in the community or customs that affect the land, or concerning general historical events important to that community, state, or nation.\\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 803(20). The advisory committee's note to rule 803(20) states that, [t]he first portion of Exception [paragraph] (20) is based upon the general admissibility of evidence of reputation as to land boundaries and land customs, expanded in this country to include private as well as public boundaries. McCormick \\u00a7 299, p. 625.[] The reputation is required to antedate the controversy, though not to be ancient. The second portion is likewise supported by authority, id., and is designed to facilitate proof of events when judicial notice is not available. The historical character of the subject matter dispenses with any need that the reputation antedate the controversy with respect to which it is offered. Fed. R. Evid. 803 advisory committee's note. The Federal Rules of Evidence Manual states that, [t]o qualify for admission under Rule 803(20), the testimony must report a general consensus in the community, an assertion of the group as opposed to one or a few of its constituents. The fact that the information has been considered by and was subject to the general scrutiny of the community is an essential guarantee of reliability for the exception. Consequently, if the statement is a personal assertion of a single declarant, it will not be admitted under Rule 803(20). Saltzburg, supra, at 803-94. The Advisory Committee Note to rule 803 discusses the rationale behind reputation-based exceptions to the rule against hearsay: Trustworthiness in reputation evidence is found \\u201cwhen the topic is such that the facts are likely to have been inquired about and that persons having personal knowledge have disclosed facts which have thus been discussed in the community; and thus the community's conclusions if any has been found, is likely to be a trustworthy one.\\u201d 5 Wigmore \\u00a7 1580 \\u2024 On this common foundation, reputation as to land boundaries, customs, general history, character, and marriage have come to be regarded as admissible. The breadth of the underlying principle suggests the formulation of an equally broad exception, but tradition has in fact been much narrower and more particularized, and this is the pattern of these exceptions in the rule. Fed. R. Evid. 803 advisory committee's note. 337.\\u2003To have significant probative value to qualify for admission under rule 803(20), the matter in question \\u201cmust be one of general interest, so that it can accurately be said that there is a high probability that the matter underwent general scrutiny as the community reputation was formed.\\u201d McCormick on Evidence \\u00a7 322, at 554 (Kenneth S. Broun ed., 7th ed. 2013)(quoted by the Honorable Bruce S. Jenkins, United States District Judge for the District of Utah, in Ute Indian Tribe v. State of Utah, 521 F. Supp. 1072, 1149 (D. Utah 1981)(Jenkins, J.), rev'd in part on other grounds, 716 F.2d 1298 (10th Cir. 1983)). See Mont. Power Co. v. Fed. Power Comm'n, 185 F.2d 491 (D.C. Cir. 1950)(admitting newspaper accounts and histories describing river's navigable nature during the nineteenth century to prove river's reputation for navigability during the nineteenth century). Wigmore states this \\u201cgeneral interest\\u201d component even more emphatically: [T]he facts for which such an opinion or reputation can be taken as trustworthy must \\u2024 be such facts as have been of interest to all members of the community as such, and therefore have been so likely to receive general and intelligent discussion and examination by competent persons, so that the community's received opinion on the subject cannot be supposed to have reached the condition of definite decision until the matter had gone, in public belief, beyond the stage of controversy and had become settled with fair finality. 5 Wigmore on Evidence, supra, \\u00a7 1598, at 564-65. 338.\\u2003Regarding the \\u201cgeneral historical events important to [the] community\\u201d clause, Fed. R. Evid. 803(20), the Honorable Marvin E. Frankel, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, stated: \\u201cIt is generally recognized that reputation is acceptable as proof of historical events of general interest in the community, despite the fact that such evidence is hearsay.\\u201d Pan Am. World Airways, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 368 F. Supp. 1098, 1104 n.5 (S.D.N.Y. 1973)(Frankel, J.). Hence, the rationale for this clause is: (i) a need for the evidence, because of the likelihood that other evidence cannot be obtained; and (ii) reliability, because the testimony represents the consensus of the community. See Advisory Committee's Note to Original Rule, reprinted at \\u00a7 803 App. 01[2] (\\u201c[Rule 803(20)] is designed to facilitate proof of events when judicial notice is not available.\\u201d). See Pan Am. World Airways, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 368 F. Supp. at 1104 (\\u201cWe have made pragmatic judgments in ruling from time to time that dubious or suspect evidence should be taken from all sides, however skeptically, when the practical alternative was to have no evidence of any kind.\\u201d). 339.\\u2003Courts are inclined to permit testimony pursuant to rule 803(20), although indicia of bias limits its probative value. See United States v. Belfast, 611 F.3d 783, 794 (11th Cir. 2010); Ute Indian Tribe v. State of Utah, 521 F. Supp. at 1075. In Ute Indian Tribe v. State of Utah, which involved a dispute about reservation boundaries, Judge Jenkins concluded that \\u201creputation in a non-Indian community as to Indian boundaries, rights, etc., is indeed a treacherous ground for decision,\\u201d because reputation evidence admitted pursuant to rule 803(20) is reliable only when it is of general interest, and the American Indian boundaries in that case were not of general interest before the dispute arose. 521 F. Supp. at 1149 (\\u201cWhile, as counsel for the counties points out, [boundary] reputation evidence is generally admissible in federal court under Rule 803(20), its reliability in these specific circumstances is suspect.\\u201d). In United States v. Belfast, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a conviction for torture offenses committed in Liberia while the defendant's father was Liberia's President. See 611 F.3d at 783. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting testimony by a Liberia Desk Officer at the United States Department of State when the testimony was limited to Liberian political party descriptions. See 611 F.3d at 821. The \\u201ctestimony concerned nothing more than historical background about Liberia and its political structure, as necessary to educate the jury,\\u201d and thus satisfied rule 803(20). United States v. Belfast, 611 F.3d at 821. 4.\\u2003Rule 803(21). 340.\\u2003Hearsay statements are admissible under 803(21) when such statements concern \\u201creputation among a person's associates or in the community concerning the person's character.\\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 803(21). According to the Advisory Committee's Note, rule 803(19) recognizes the traditional acceptance of reputation evidence as a means of proving human character. McCormick \\u00a7\\u00a7 44, 158. The exception deals only with the hearsay aspect of this kind of evidence. Limitations upon admissibility based on other grounds will be found in Rules 404, relevancy of character evidence generally, and 608, character of witness. The exception is in effect a reiteration, in the context of hearsay, of Rule 405(a). Fed. R. Evid. 803 advisory committee's note. 341.\\u2003For a statement to qualify under the rule 803(21) hearsay exception, the offering witness must demonstrate that he or she \\u201cknows the person and is truly familiar with the \\u2018community\\u2019 in which the reputation has been formed, and that the basis of the reputation is one that is likely reliable.\\u201d Blackburn v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 179 F.3d 81, 101 (3d Cir. 1999). The character evidence hearsay exception for reputation as to character ensures that a hearsay objection will not bar reception of otherwise inadmissible, but sometimes desirable, evidence. See United States v. Penson, 896 F.2d 1087, 1092-93 (7th Cir. 1990)(concluding that a co-conspirator's testimony that \\u201che knew of a man named Keith who in turn had a customer named Gene \\u2018who had a truck driver [defendant] that had provided him with this exact service\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d was admissible to show defendant's reputation within the drug-trafficking community). Cf. United States v. Arroyo, 406 F.3d 881, 887-88 (7th Cir. 2005)(holding that informant's statement that defendant was believed to have \\u201cripped\\u201d two kilos of cocaine during a drug sale was not admissible under rule 803(21), because statement was not related to \\u201creputation of [defendant's] character among associates or in the community,\\u201d but to a rumor about a specific prior act and others' intentions to harm informant); Dick v. Phone Directories Co., Inc., 397 F.3d 1256, 1266 (10th Cir. 2005)(holding that hearsay testimony, that defendant's office was known as \\u201cthe lesbian factory,\\u201d was not admissible under rule 803(21), because testimony concerned neither a person nor her character). 5.\\u2003Rule 807. 342.\\u2003Rule 807, the Residual Exception to the rule against hearsay, provides that, [u]nder the following circumstances, a hearsay statement is not excluded by the rule against hearsay even if the statement is not specifically covered by a hearsay exception in Rule 803 or 804: (1) the statement has equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness; (2) it is offered as evidence of a material fact; (3) it is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence that the proponent can obtain through reasonable efforts; and (4) admitting it will best serve the purposes of these rules and the interests of justice. Fed. R. Evid. 807. Furthermore, this rule requires that \\u201cthe statement is admissible only if, before the trial or hearing, the proponent gives an adverse party reasonable notice of the intent to offer the statement and its particulars, including the declarant's name and address, so that the party has a fair opportunity to meet it.\\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 807(b). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has summarized the policies that the residual hearsay exception serves: 1.\\u2003To provide sufficient flexibility to permit the courts to deal with new and unanticipated situations. 2.\\u2003To preserve the integrity of the specifically enumerated exceptions. 3.\\u2003To facilitate the basic purpose of the Federal Rules of Evidence: truth ascertainment and fair adjudication of controversies. United States v. Sposito, 106 F.3d 1042, 1048 (1st Cir. 1997)(citing 11 Moore's Federal Practice \\u00a7 803(24)[7] (2d ed. 1994 & Supp.1996-97)). These purposes are consistent with the suggestions of many of the leading evidence scholars over the past century and further rule 807's objective to make relevant evidence admissible. See United States v. Moore, 824 F.3d 620, 624 (7th Cir. 2016)(\\u201cThe purpose of Rule 807 is to make sure that reliable, material hearsay evidence is admitted, regardless of whether it fits neatly into one of the exceptions enumerated in the Rules of Evidence.\\u201d). 343.\\u2003Given that rule 807 authorizes hearsay admission not within the precise confines of a recognized exception, the courts interpret the residual exception to admit hearsay evidence of high probative value in individual situations, but not to create new exceptions. See United States v. Doe, 860 F.2d 488, 491 (1st Cir. 1988)(concluding that the residual exception criteria \\u201cinvolve considerations which are very trial-specific, such as the relative probative value of the hearsay statement and whether admitting the statement will best serve \\u2018the interests of justice\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d)(quoting Fed. R. Evid. 803(24)). But cf. Garner v. United States, 439 U.S. 936, 940 n.3, 99 S.Ct. 333, 58 L.Ed.2d 333, (1978)(Stewart, J., dissenting)(\\u201cIt seems to me open to serious doubt whether [the residual exception] was intended to provide case-by-case hearsay exceptions, or rather only to permit expansion of the hearsay exceptions by categories.\\u201d). The residual hearsay exception is \\u201cmeant to be reserved for exceptional cases,\\u201d and is \\u201cnot intended to confer \\u2018a broad license\\u2019 on trial judges \\u2018to admit hearsay statements that do not fall within one of the other exceptions contained in rules 803 and 804(b).\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Conoco Inc., v. Dep't of Energy, 99 F.3d at 392 (quoting S. Rep. No. 94-199, at 20 (1975)). See United States v. Trujillo, 136 F.3d 1388, 1395-96 (10th Cir. 1998)(stating that, because residual hearsay exceptions are intended for \\u201cexceptional circumstances,\\u201d offerors of such evidence bear a \\u201cheavy burden\\u201d of presenting the trial court with sufficient indicia of trustworthiness). Hence, evidence admitted pursuant to rule 807 must have \\u201ccircumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness\\u201d comparable to those of the enumerated rule 803 exceptions. United States v. Harrison, 296 F.3d 994, 1004-07 (10th Cir. 2002)(holding that child sexual abuse victim's statement to Federal Bureau of Investigation (\\u201cFBI\\u201d) agent had circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, even though victim recanted her statement, because the statement was consistent with her earlier statements and was specific, and victim was old enough to have the ability to remember the events). See United States v. Trujillo, 136 F.3d at 1395-96; United States v. Tome, 61 F.3d 1446, 1453 (10th Cir. 1995)(concluding that child's statement to caseworker identifying abuser, made a year after attack, lacked guarantees of trustworthiness); United States v. Farley, 992 F.2d 1122, 1126 (10th Cir. 1993). In United States v. Farley, for example, the Tenth Circuit admitted, pursuant to rule 807, a child sexual abuse victim's assault account, as given to victim's mother, even though some statements were made the morning after the assault, because the victim was still suffering pain and distress from the assault, the victim employed childish terminology, and the victim's youth reduced the likelihood that the statements were fabricated. See 992 F.2d at 1126. 344.\\u2003In determining the trustworthiness of hearsay offered under the residual exception, the Tenth Circuit considers factors such as: (i) the statement's character; (ii) whether the statement is written or oral; (iii) the parties' relationship; (iv) the declarant's probable motivation in making the statement; and (v) the circumstances under which the statement is made. See United States v. Lawrence, 405 F.3d 888, 902 (10th Cir. 2005)(concluding that statements made to FBI agents by physician at defendant's clinic, including that he did not believe he was legally required to be at the clinic to supervise medical work, were not admissible under rule 807, in defendant's Medicare fraud trial, because statements had no circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, statements were taken shortly after FBI executed search warrant on clinic, and physician was the subject of the same investigation that eventually led to charges against defendant); Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Kuykendall, 312 F.3d 1329, 1343 (10th Cir. 2002)(concluding that consumer declarations and complaints had sufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness to warrant admission under rule 807 in a civil contempt proceeding arising from the defendants' violation of a permanent injunction, because they were made under oath and subject to penalty of perjury). For admissibility under rule 807, a statement must be \\u201cmore probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence that the proponent can obtain through reasonable efforts.\\u201d Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Kuykendall, 312 F.3d at 1343 (concluding that consumer declarations and complaints were trustworthy and most probative evidence available, and therefore admissible under rule 807, provided defendants had adequate notice); United States v. Zamora, 784 F.2d 1025, 1031 (10th Cir. 1986)(concluding that hearsay statements were properly excluded in absence of showing of statement's probative value or any effort to obtain information from other sources). The Tenth Circuit considers a statement \\u201cmore probative\\u201d if the district court determines that the hearsay is relevant and reliable, and that no other evidence, or little other evidence, is available on the same point. Marsee v. U.S. Tobacco Co., 866 F.2d 319, 324-25 (10th Cir. 1989)(concluding that reports were not admissible, because much of their contents were already admitted through expert testimony). 345.\\u2003Rule 807 requires the district court to consider the availability of other admissible evidence through reasonable efforts, which depend on matters such as the importance of the evidence and the proponent's ability to provide it. See Calderon v. Presidio Valley Farmers Ass'n, 863 F.2d 384, 391-92 (5th Cir. 1989)(concluding that answers to interrogatories were admissible pursuant to rule 807, because relevant records were lost or destroyed, trial was held several years after violations took place, and witnesses were illiterate); United States v. Shaw, 824 F.2d 601, 610 (8th Cir. 1987)(stating that exceptional circumstances generally exist when child relates abuse details to adult). Courts must consider the need for the evidence in light of the basic assumption underlying the rule against hearsay -- that statements made directly in the courtroom are more reliable than hearsay; in other words, courts must balance need against trustworthiness. See United States v. Harrison, 296 F.3d at 1004-07. Admission of evidence under the residual exception must accord with \\u201cthe purposes of these rules and the interests of justice.\\u201d New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Anderson, 888 F.2d 646, 650-51 (10th Cir. 1989)(concluding that the district court properly excluded statements reported in newspaper article, because the district court found no guarantees of trustworthiness and the plaintiff failed to show that admission of the article without opportunity to cross-examine witness would serve interests of justice); Marsee v. U.S. Tobacco Co., 866 F.2d 319, 325 (10th Cir. 1989)(stating that the interests of justice did not require admission of reports at issue). LAW REGARDING AMERICAN INDIAN ORAL TRADITION EVIDENCE 346.\\u2003American Indian oral tradition evidence \\u201cconsist[s] of oral accounts handed down from father to son in continuity -- from generation to generation from time immemorial. Traditionally, this has been the principal tribal record of the history of all Indian tribes.\\u201d Pueblo de Zia v. United States, 165 Ct. Cl. at 504. Because oral tradition evidence purports to prove historical events based on out-of-court statements offered for their truth, such evidence implicates reliability concerns attendant to hearsay and thus may be inadmissible in courts of law. See Sokaogon Chippewa Community v. Exxon Corp., 2 F.3d 219, 222 (7th Cir. 1993)(\\u201cThe oral tradition of a promised reservation is not evidence, that is, evidence admissible in a court of law.\\u201d (emphasis in original)). Hearsay is an out-of-court statement \\u201coffer[ed] in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement,\\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 801(c), and is generally inadmissible as evidence \\u201cbecause it is considered unreliable,\\u201d United States v. Lozado, 776 F.3d 1119, 1121 (10th Cir. 2015)(citing Williamson v. United States, 512 U.S. 594, 598, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 129 L.Ed.2d 476 (1994)). See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c) (defining hearsay as an out-of-court statement offered \\u201cto prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement\\u201d). Although the rule against hearsay is subject to numerous exceptions, see Fed. R. Evid. 801-807, neither the Tenth Circuit nor any other Court of Appeals has permitted American Indian oral tradition evidence pursuant to any codified exception to the rule against hearsay. 347.\\u2003American Indian oral tradition evidence is seen primarily in (i) land claims and (ii) funerary repatriation claims. Land claims require Tribal claimants to show that they have occupied the land in question for a significant period, which claimants can often accomplish only through oral tradition evidence. See Sokaogon Chippewa Cmty. v. Exxon Corp., 2 F.3d at 222; Zuni Tribe of N.M. v. United States, 12 Cl. Ct. at 616; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Or. v. United States, 177 Ct. Cl. at 204; Pueblo de Zia v. United States, 165 Ct. Cl. at 505; Coos Bay Indian Tribe v. United States, 87 Ct. Cl. at 152-53; Assiniboine Indian Tribe v. United States, 77 Ct. Cl. 347, 368 (1933). Furthermore, Tribal claimants may use oral tradition evidence to repatriate sacred funerary objects or human remains pursuant to the Native Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 3001-3005 (\\u201cNAGPRA\\u201d). Bonnichsen v. United States, 367 F.3d at 875. NAGPRA places oral tradition evidence on the same plane as documentary evidence by requiring the return of funerary objects upon a showing of cultural affiliation, by a preponderance of the evidence, based on \\u201cgeographical, kinship, biological, archaeological, anthropological, linguistic, folkloric, oral traditional, historical, or other relevant information or expert opinion.\\u201d 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 3005(a)(4). The statute makes oral tradition evidence part of the adjudicative process and expressly treats hearsay evidence as admissible by requiring that the decision maker must consider \\u201coral tradition\\u201d in evaluating the strength of a claim of cultural affiliation. 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 3005(a)(4). See Deborah L. Threedy, Claiming the Shields: Law, Anthropology, and the Role of Storytelling in a NAGPRA Repatriation Case Study, 29. J. Land, Resources & Envt'l. L. 91, 109 (2009). 1.\\u2003Admitted, Discredited Oral Tradition Evidence. 348.\\u2003The American courts that have admitted or considered uncontroverted oral tradition evidence have historically discredited this evidence. See Bonnichsen v. United States, 367 F.3d at 881-82; Sokaogon Chippewa Cmty. v. Exxon Corp., 2 F.3d at 222; Coos Bay Indian Tribes v. United States, 87 Ct. Cl. at 152-53; Assiniboine Indian Tribe v. United States, 77 Ct. Cl. at 368. Several United States Court of Claims and United States Court of Appeals decisions address oral tradition evidence although such discussion is limited to passing mention in dicta. See Bonnichsen v. United States, 367 F.3d at 881-82; Sokaogon Chippewa Cmty. v. Exxon Corp., 2 F.3d at 222; Coos Bay Indian Tribe v. United States, 8 Ct. Cl. at 152-53; Assiniboine Indian Tribe v. United States, 77 Ct. Cl. at 368. What these cases share is the decision to give no weight to oral tradition evidence. a. United States Court of Claims Cases. 349.\\u2003In Assiniboine Indian Tribe v. United States, Tribal claimants sought the right of occupancy to two tracts of land, one of which fell under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851. See 77 Ct. Cl. at 362-63. The claimant American Indian Tribe was required to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it had occupied the land in question by \\u201cimmemorial possession.\\u201d 77 Ct. Cl. at 358. Although the Court of Claims was not explicit in the particulars of the evidence that the Tribe submitted, to include whether formal objection controverted such evidence, it stated that the \\u201c[p]laintiff \\u2024 introduced the greater number of witnesses giving oral testimony.\\u201d 77 Ct. Cl. at 366. The Court of Claims, however, refused to credit this evidence, stating that \\u201cmuch of the evidence \\u2024 is from a source that lessens its weight[,]\\u201d 77 Ct. Cl. at 366, and emphasizing that the witnesses \\u201cwere either \\u2024 children at the time of the signing of the treaty or very old men at the time when they gave their testimony, and on account of age having at best a very incomplete recollection of matters that occurred fifty years prior thereto,\\u201d 77 Ct. Cl. at 369. The Court of Claims concluded that \\u201c[t]he circumstances of the case make this testimony so unsatisfactory as to be unworthy of any credit.\\u201d 77 Ct. Cl. at 369. In place of the oral tradition evidence, the Court of Claims favored the testimony of \\u201cGovernment agents,\\u201d 77 Ct. Cl. at 369, asserting that the agents were less biased and had lived with the Tribe for a considerable period of time, thereby adding to their credibility, see 77 Ct. Cl. at 367. The agents alleged that the Tribe had migrated often during their history and that they had never excluded other Tribes from the land in question. See 77 Ct. Cl. at 360. The Court of Claims concluded that the Tribe did not occupy the land for the requisite period of time and thus denied its occupancy claim. See 77 Ct. Cl. at 368. 350.\\u2003In Coos Bay Indian Tribe v. United States, the Coos Bay Indian Tribe resided on a reservation over which they did not have treaty rights. See 87 Ct. Cl. at 148. In 1855, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs in Oregon, authorized by an act of Congress, negotiated a treaty with the Tribe for the possession of the Tribe's land. See 87 Ct. Cl. at 150. The treaty was never ratified, and the Tribe therefore sought to prove its occupation of the land through oral tradition evidence. See 87 Ct. Cl. at 152. Similar to its decision in Assiniboine Indian Tribe v. United States, the Court of Claims in Coos Bay Indian Tribe v. United States did not describe the oral tradition evidence in its opinion, to include whether the evidence was controverted or introduced absent objection. See 87 Ct. Cl. at 150-53. Instead, the Court of Claims stated that \\u201c[i]f this testimony is to prevail in every way over documentary and historical evidence it is sufficient to observe that it does prove by hearsay that plaintiffs did occupy the lands claimed from time immemorial[,]\\u201d thereby suggesting that the Court of Claims may not have applied the rule against hearsay to oral tradition evidence as it did to most oral evidence. 87 Ct. Cl. at 152. Nevertheless, the Court of Claims concluded that the oral testimony was insufficient on its own to carry the Tribal claimants' burden of proof. See 87 Ct. Cl. at 152-53. The Court of Claims emphasized that \\u201cat least seventeen of the twenty-one witnesses produced ha[d] a direct interest in the outcome of the case\\u201d; thus, according to the Court of Claims, the oral tradition evidence could not overcome the written evidence that the United States presented. 87 Ct. Cl. at 152. b. United States Court of Appeals Cases. 351.\\u2003In Sokaogon Chippewa Community v. Exxon Corp., the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit refused to admit oral tradition evidence because of concerns over oral tradition reliability. See 2 F.3d at 222. In Sokaogon Chippewa Community v. Exxon Corp., the Sokaogon Indians sought a declaration that the Tribe had the right to occupy a particular tract of land rich in mineral deposits. See 2 F.3d at 220. The issue before the Seventh Circuit was whether the Sokaogon had ceded its aboriginal right after negotiating a treaty during the 1800s. See 2 F.3d at 221. The Tribe primarily used oral tradition evidence to detail the United States' promise to include the land in question in a reservation for a discrete group of Chippewa Indian band, the Post Lake band. See 2 F.3d at 222. The Honorable Richard A. Posner, former Circuit Judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, stated that \\u201cthere is no documentation of this tradition, which is at best embroidered (too many ransoms, shipwrecks, lost and stolen maps, and deathbed revelations to be plausible) and at worst fictitious.\\u201d 2 F.3d at 222. Moreover, Judge Posner continues, \\u201c[n]o government document so much as hints at any such promise \\u2024 and several government documents state that the Post Lake bands are not entitled to their own reservation.\\u201d 2 F.3d at 222. Judge Posner thus held that the Sokaogon had failed to state a claim sufficient to survive summary judgment. See 2 F.3d at 224. Judge Posner concluded that the oral tradition evidence was not admissible, because \\u201cno effort was made by the Sokaogon's counsel to cast it into a form in which it would be admissible in a court of law.\\u201d 2 F.3d at 224-25. 352.\\u2003In Bonnichsen v. United States, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit examined the use of oral tradition evidence within NAGPRA's context. See 367 F.3d at 881-82. The claim in Bonnichsen v. United States involved approximately 9,000-year-old human remains that were found in the State of Washington. See 367 F.3d at 868. Because of the remains' extreme age, archaeologists and other scientists desired to study the body. See 367 F.3d at 868. A coalition of Indian Tribes, however, sought to have the remains, known popularly as the \\u201cKennewick Man,\\u201d repatriated under NAGPRA. 367 F.3d at 869-70. A Department of the Interior final decision awarded the remains to the American Indians, and, in Bonnichsen v. United States, a group of scientists sought judicial review of that decision. See 367 F.3d at 875. In ruling for the scientists on appeal, the Ninth Circuit stated that, because the value of [oral tradition] accounts is limited by concerns of authenticity, reliability, and accuracy, and because the record as a whole does not show where historical fact ends and mythic tale begins, we do not think that the oral traditions \\u2024 were adequate to show the required significant relationship of the Kennewick Man's remains to the Tribal Claimants\\u2024 8340 to 9200 years between the life of Kennewick Man and the present is too long a time to bridge merely with evidence of oral traditions. 367 F.3d at 875. Hence, Bonnichsen v. United States indicates that, although NAGPRA allows courts to admit oral tradition evidence, it remains unclear whether courts will give weight to oral tradition evidence without corroboration by other evidence. 2.\\u2003Admitted, Credited Oral Tradition Evidence. 353.\\u2003In at least three cases brought before the ICC, and a fourth arising by special jurisdictional act of Congress, the Court of Claims, and its successor court, the United States Claims Court, explicitly recognized and assigned evidentiary weight to oral tradition evidence. See Wally v. United States, 148 Ct. Cl. at 373-74; Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Or. v. United States, 177 Ct. Cl. at 184; Pueblo de Zia v. United States, 165 Ct. Cl. at 505; Zuni Tribe of N.M. v. United States, 12 Cl. Ct. at 616 n.12. 354.\\u2003In Pueblo de Zia, the Tribal claimants appealed from an ICC decision which held that oral tradition evidence from various Tribal council members was insufficient to prove aboriginal title to land that the United States had taken. See Pueblo de Zia, 165 Ct. Cl. at 503-04. The testimony consisted of \\u201coral accounts handed down from father to son \\u2024 from time immemorial.\\u201d 165 Ct. Cl. at 504. The United States' brief stated that the evidence was \\u201cliterally worthless.\\u201d 165 Ct. Cl. at 505. The Court of Claims, in contrast, emphasized that, because the United States did not proffer any evidence of its own, and because the oral tradition evidence was corroborated, the oral tradition evidence was therefore \\u201centitled to some weight; it cannot be ignored or discarded.\\u201d 165 Ct. Cl. at 505 (emphasis in original). As support for this conclusion, the Court of Claims cited Rapid Transit Co. v. United States, 295 F. 2d 465, 466-67 (10th Cir. 1961), wherein the Tenth Circuit adopted the rule that the Supreme Court of Kansas enunciated in Gibbs v. Central Surety and Insurance Corporation, 163 Kan. 252, 181 P.2d 498, 499 (1947), as follows: [W]here plaintiff produces two witnesses who testify on every material element of plaintiff's cause of action, and such testimony is not inherently improbable or uncandid, and the cross-examination does not develop any conflict, and the defendant produces no testimony in opposition, the trier of fact is not justified in arbitrary or capriciously disregarding such testimony. Gibbs v. Cent. Sur. and Ins. Corp., 181 P.2d at 499 (quoted by the Tenth Circuit in Rapid Transit Co. v. United States, 295 F.2d at 466-67). Nevertheless, the Court of Claims qualified the use of the oral traditional evidence by suggesting that \\u201ccorroboration of historical and archaeological evidence and testimony\\u201d may be necessary. 165 Ct. Cl. at 504. 355.\\u2003In Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon v. United States, the Tribal claimants sought to prove aboriginal title to land ceded to the United States under the Treaty of June 25, 1855, 12 Stat. 963. See Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Or. v. United States, 177 Ct. Cl. at 184. Although the Court of Claims followed the reasoning in Pueblo de Zia v. United States, by stating that oral tradition evidence \\u201cis entitled to some weight, and is not to be deemed worthless, particularly when it is corroborated by documents and the testimony of others,\\u201d the Court of Claims added that \\u201c[t]he importance of corroboration and cross-checking cannot be undervalued since informants can mislead researchers by describing some period (usually the reservation one) besides the aboriginal, pre-treaty period.\\u201d Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Or. v. United States, 177 Ct. Cl. at 204. Thus, although Pueblo de Zia v. United States and Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Or. v. United States established that Tribal claimants could use oral traditional evidence in the Court of Claims, the requirement of corroboration by outside sources severely limits such use. 356.\\u2003In Wally v. United States, the Court of Claims allowed testimony as to reputation about facts that Tribal witnesses did not know personally to show the extent of American Indian land boundaries: Community reputation about facts which are no longer available to individuals or susceptible of other proof has long been admissible to show the location of ancient boundaries\\u2024 The reason for this rule is not only caused by the perishable nature of boundary markers, but also because general reputation about facts of community interests are generally trustworthy. It is unlikely that a falsehood could become generally accepted in a community as the truth. The prolonged and constant exposure of these facts to observation and discussion by the community sifts out the possible errors and gives to the residual facts which are generally accepted by the locality a trustworthiness which allows these facts to be presented as evidence in a court of law. 148 Ct. Cl. at 373-74. The ICC thus permitted uncontroverted oral tradition evidence as testimony to prove the reputation of facts about past events that are known by the community as a whole, but are no longer available to individuals. See 148 Ct. Cl. at 373-74. 357.\\u2003In Zuni Tribe of New Mexico v. United States, Tribal claimants sought compensation for the United States' alleged taking of tribal lands. See 12 Cl. Ct. at 607. The Claims Court admitted large amounts of oral tradition evidence, and the Tribal claimants ultimately succeeded in proving their claim to the lands in question. See 12 Cl. Ct. at 641. Notably, the Claims Court accepted the oral tradition evidence against the United States' protestations: Defendant conjectures, but offers no evidence to contradict or impeach the Zuni recounting of their history. And, given the import attached to the oral transmission of history and religious observation by the Zuni, there is no reason to suspect gross or deliberate distortion. Accordingly, the court is persuaded that, notwithstanding some insufficiency, this recounted history is of evidentiary probity. 12 Cl. Ct. at 616 n.12. Nevertheless, the Claims Court did not describe the oral tradition evidence, provide any binding authority for other courts to follow, or explain why it was persuaded that the histories were \\u201cof evidentiary probity.\\u201d 12 Cl. Ct. at 616 n.12. LAW REGARDING ABORIGINAL TITLE 358.\\u2003Aboriginal title, or original Indian title, refers to American Indian land occupancy rights premised on exclusive use and occupancy of a particular territory at the time of first European contact, and to an entitlement arising subsequent to such contact under the governing European sovereign's laws, which are derived largely from international law concepts that prevailed before the American Revolution. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1151-56 (discussing Indian law and aboriginal title history); Felix Cohen, Original Indian Title, 32 Minn. L. Rev. 28, 43-44 (1947)(\\u201cOur concepts of Indian title derive only in part from common law feudal concepts. In the main, they are to be traced to Spanish origins, and particularly to doctrines developed by Francisco de Vitoria, the real founder of modern international law.\\u201d). A Tribe establishes aboriginal title by \\u201cimmemorial occupancy \\u2024 to the exclusion of other Indians,\\u201d i.e., by continually and exclusively fishing, hunting, gathering, and otherwise occupying lands. Northwestern Bands of Shoshone Indians v. United States, 324 U.S. 335, 338-39, 65 S.Ct. 690, 89 L.Ed. 985 (1945). Aboriginal title exists at the United States' pleasure, and the United States may effectuate aboriginal title extinguishment \\u201cby treaty, by the sword, by purchase, by the exercise of complete domination adverse to the right of occupancy, or otherwise.\\u201d Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 347, 62 S.Ct. 248. Although Congress has the exclusive power to extinguish aboriginal title, intent to do so must be \\u201cplain and unambiguous,\\u201d and will not be \\u201clightly implied.\\u201d Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 346, 354, 62 S.Ct. 248. Notwithstanding this requirement, several federal courts have held that Congressional acts in anticipation of settlement and public use, and actual settlement, by non-Indians are factors that may effect extinguishment. See, e.g., United States v. Gemmill, 535 F.2d at 1147; United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1391; Gila River Pima-Maricopa Indian Cmty. v. United States, 494 F.2d at 1386. 1.\\u2003Establishment of Aboriginal Title. 359.\\u2003Among the ways that American Indian Tribes may acquire real property interests is through possession and exercise of sovereignty, and, within the bundle of recognized property rights, aboriginal title refers to land claimed by sovereignty, rather than by letters patent or other formal conveyance. Aboriginal title preexists the formation of the United States. See Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 347, 62 S.Ct. 248 (\\u201cNor is it true, as respondent urges, that a tribal claim to any particular lands must be based upon a treaty, statute, or other formal government action.\\u201d); Cramer v. United States, 261 U.S. 219, 229, 43 S.Ct. 342, 67 L.Ed. 622 (1923)(\\u201cThe fact that such right of occupancy finds no recognition in any statute or other formal governmental action is not conclusive.\\u201d). See also Native Vill. of Eyak v. Blank, 688 F.3d at 622 (9th Cir. 2012)(\\u201cAboriginal rights don't depend on a treaty or an act of Congress for their existence.\\u201d); Sac & Fox Tribe of Indians of Okl. v. United States, 383 F.2d at 998-99 (stating that aboriginal title is not \\u201cfrozen\\u201d as of the date of discovery or the date of establishment of the United States). Aboriginal title is established through exclusive occupation of historic Indian lands. See Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 345, 62 S.Ct. 248 (\\u201cIf \\u2024 the lands in question \\u2024 were included in[\\u2009] the ancestral home of the Walapais in the sense that they constituted definable territory occupied exclusively by the Walapais (as distinguished from lands wandered over by many tribes), then the Walapais had \\u2018Indian title.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d (quoting Buttz v. N. Pac. R.R. Co., 119 U.S. 55, 66, 7 S.Ct. 100, 30 L.Ed. 330 (1886)). See also Native Vill. of Eyak v. Blank, 688 F.3d at 622 (\\u201c[T]he Villages have the burden of proving \\u2018actual, exclusive, and continuous use and occupancy \\u2018for a long time\\u2019 of the claimed area.\\u201d (quoting Sac & Fox Tribe of Indians of Okl. v. United States, 383 F.2d at 998))). Moreover, \\u201coccupancy necessary to establish aboriginal possession is a question of fact.\\u201d Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 345, 62 S.Ct. 248. 360.\\u2003The Supreme Court consistently has held that Tribes have a \\u201clegal as well as just claim to retain possession\\u201d of the land that they have historically occupied within the United States. Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 543, 574, 5 L.Ed. 681 (1823). Moreover, this right exists independent of the United States' recognition. See Holden v. Joy, 84 U.S. 17 Wall. 211, 244, 21 L.Ed. 523 (1872)(\\u201c[T]he Indians as tribes or nations, have been considered as distinct, independent communities, retaining their original, natural rights as the undisputed possessors of the soil, from time immemorial.\\u201d). 361.\\u2003Early Supreme Court decisions built the framework for understanding the relationship of the United States to Tribes and Tribal property. For example, in Johnson v. M'Intosh, the Marshall Court\\u2009 adopted a rule of international law known as the \\u201cdiscovery doctrine\\u201d and explained how that doctrine functions alongside United States law. See 21 U.S. at 572-74. Under the discovery doctrine, European nations claimed the right to acquire land rights from American Indians, exclusive both of other European nations and of their own subjects. See 21 U.S. at 573 (\\u201c[D]iscovery gave title to the government by whose subjects, or by whose authority, it was made, against all other European governments, which title might be consummated by possession.\\u201d). The Supreme Court in Johnson v. M'Intosh held that Tribal conveyances to private parties in 1773 and 1775 did not convey fee simple title to the lands, because English law forbade alienation of aboriginal title without the Crown's consent. See 21 U.S. at 594. Thus, the United States' later conveyances of the fee in those lands superseded the Tribe's prior conveyances. See 21 U.S. at 603-04. The Supreme Court described the Tribal interest in the land as a \\u201ctitle of occupancy,\\u201d \\u201crights of occupancy,\\u201d and \\u201cright of possession,\\u201d 21 U.S. at 583, 587, 588, and characterized the United States' interest as successor to the discoverer as the \\u201cfee,\\u201d \\u201cabsolute title,\\u201d and the \\u201cabsolute ultimate title,\\u201d 21 U.S. at 588. 362.\\u2003The discovery doctrine prevents aboriginal title alienation without the European sovereign's consent or the United States' consent, or that of the original thirteen states, as successor-in-interest. See Oneida Indian Nation v. Cty. of Oneida, 414 U.S. at 670, 94 S.Ct. 772; Seneca Nation of Indians v. Christy, 162 U.S. 283, 16 S.Ct. 828, 40 L.Ed. 970 (1896). Alongside the restraint on alienation was the exclusive power to purchase Indian land, traditionally called the \\u201cright of preemption.\\u201d Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. at 571 n.5. The discovery doctrine also provided a mechanism to validate the United States' previous acquisitions of Tribal land \\u201cby purchase or conquest.\\u201d Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. at 587. 363.\\u2003Three additional Marshall Court opinions address aboriginal title and further elaborate on the nature of Tribal rights to property: Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 30 U.S. (5 Pet. 1), 8 L.Ed. 25 (1831); Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. (6 Pet.) 515, 8 L.Ed. 483 (1832); and Mitchel v. United States, 34 U.S. (9 Pet.) 711, 9 L.Ed. 283 (1835). In Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, the Supreme Court affirmed that \\u201cthe Indians are acknowledged to have an unquestionable, and heretofore unquestioned, right to the land they occupy, until that right shall be extinguished by a voluntary cession to our government.\\u201d 30 U.S. at 32. In Worchester v. Georgia, the Supreme Court discussed extensively the doctrine of discovery and the nature of aboriginal title, and noted that, while the sovereign interest permitted the European sovereign to issue land grants still subject to aboriginal title, the issuance of a grant was insufficient by itself to extinguish such title. See 31 U.S. at 546. Until the European sovereign purchased the land from a given Tribe, the grant \\u201casserted a title against Europeans only and was considered as blank paper so far as the rights of natives were concerned.\\u201d 31 U.S. at 546. In Mitchel v. United States, the Supreme Court upheld the validity of title acquired from an Indian Tribe in present-day Florida, because Spain had ratified the Tribal sale and thereby extinguished aboriginal title to the property. See 34 U.S. at 751-53. The Supreme Court affirmed the notion that aboriginal title was \\u201cas sacred as the fee simple of the whites\\u201d and analogized the sovereign's right as an \\u201cultimate reversion in fee\\u201d subject to the Tribe's \\u201cperpetual right of occupancy.\\u201d 34 U.S. at 746, 756. 364.\\u2003Although refusing to accord American Indians full sovereignty and title over their lands, the Marshall Court cases nevertheless afford ample respect to aboriginal title. See, e.g., Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. at 574 (stating that aboriginal title makes a Tribe's members \\u201cthe rightful occupants of the soil, with a legal as well as just claim to retain possession of it\\u201d). The Supreme Court respected the Tribal right to retain possession, provided Tribes remained at peace with the United States. See Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. at 591 (\\u201c[T]he Indian inhabitants are to be considered merely as occupants, to be protected, indeed, while in peace, in the possession of their lands.\\u201d). These cases further recognize Tribal sovereignty over Tribal lands by asserting that Tribal members and others who acquire land from Tribes are subject to Tribal law. See Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. at 593 (\\u201cThe person who purchases lands from the Indians, within their territory, incorporates himself with them, so far as respects the property purchased; holds their title under their protection, and subject to their laws.\\u201d). In contrast, only the United States could extinguish aboriginal title, with purchase being the preferred acquisition method. See Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. at 586. While Congress and the President did not always follow these principles, the Supreme Court consistently reiterated and applied them to protect aboriginal title. See, e.g., Cty. of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation, 470 U.S. at 235, 105 S.Ct. 1245 (collecting cases); Holden v. Joy, 84 U.S. at 244 (stating that aboriginal title is \\u201cabsolute, subject only to the [federal] pre-emption right of purchase\\u201d); Chouteau v. Molony, 57 U.S. (16 How.) 203, 203, 14 L.Ed. 905 (1853)(interpreting Spanish fee grant as confirming easement granted previously to Tribe). 365.\\u2003A Tribe asserting aboriginal title may bring a federal common-law action to enforce ownership rights. See, e.g., Cty. of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation, 470 U.S. at 235-36, 105 S.Ct. 1245 (collecting cases). Moreover, the Supreme Court has stated that occupancy necessary to establish aboriginal possession is a question of fact, determined as any other question of fact. See Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 359-60, 62 S.Ct. 248 (\\u201cAs we have said, occupancy necessary to establish aboriginal possession is a question of fact.\\u201d). The Court of Claims has concluded that factual support for an aboriginal title claim may include: evidence that no other Tribes claimed or used the areas involved, a neighboring Tribe's recognition of ownership, earlier official European sovereign recognition of the Tribe's exclusive title, and expert testimony of historians in the field of American history. See Otoe & Missouria Tribe v. United States, 131 F. Supp. 265, 289-91 (Ct. Cl. 1955). 2.\\u2003Scope and Limits of Aboriginal Title. 366.\\u2003The requirement that aboriginal title be based on possession or occupancy, as opposed to official documentation, raises important questions about the nature and extent of possession required to support aboriginal title. Since the earliest Spanish conquests, opponents of American Indian property rights have argued that hunting, gathering, and other uses which involve only occasional human presence are not sufficient to constitute possession. See, e.g., Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 543, 567, 5 L.Ed. 681 (\\u201cOn the part of the defendants, it was insisted, that the uniform understanding and practice of European nations, and the settled law, as laid down by the tribunals of civilized states, denied the right of the Indians to be considered as independent communities, having a permanent property in the soil.\\u201d). Opponents of such rights argued that courts should declare Indian lands vacant and available to the first Europeans to put them to commercial use. See Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. at 588-89. Alternatively, they argued that hunting rights should be nonexclusive, similar to fishing rights in public lands. See Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. at 567-71 (citing as justification the scholarship of notable European authors Locke, Grotius, Montesquieu, and de Vattel\\u2009). The Marshall Court, however, rejected these arguments in Johnson v. M'Intosh and again in Mitchel v. United States, both of which recognize aboriginal title based on traditional Tribal use alone. See Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. at 569-70; Mitchel v. United States, 34 U.S. at 746 (1835)(\\u201c[T]heir hunting grounds were as much in their actual possession as the cleared fields of the whites.\\u201d). 367.\\u2003In treaties with the United States, the limit of aboriginal title correspond with the limit of a Tribe's exclusive possession that other Tribes respected, i.e. with a Tribe's national boundaries; therefore, proof of exclusive and continuous occupation of the land determines the boundary of land claimed under aboriginal title. See, e.g., United States v. Alcea Band of Tillamooks, 329 U.S. 40, 40, 67 S.Ct. 167, 91 L.Ed. 29 (1946); Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 345, 62 S.Ct. 248; Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165. See also Yankton Sioux Tribe of Indians v. South Dakota, 796 F.2d 241, 243 (8th Cir. 1986)(\\u201cIn order to establish aboriginal title, an Indian tribe must show that it actually, exclusively, and continuously used the property for an extended period of time.\\u201d). Thus, to establish the extent of a land claim under aboriginal title, a Tribe must show that it \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018used and occupied the land to the exclusion of other Indian Groups.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165-66 (emphasis in original)(quoting Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1394). See Native Village of Eyak, 688 F.3d at 624 (\\u201cExclusivity is established when a tribe or a group shows that it used and occupied the land to the exclusion of other Indian groups.\\u201d (emphasis in original)). This requirement means that the Tribe must have behaved as an owner of the land by exercising dominion and control. See Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 345, 62 S.Ct. 248. See also Native Vill. of Eyak v. Blank, 688 F.3d at 623 (\\u201cThe tribe or group must exercise full dominion and control over the area, such that it \\u2018possesses the right to expel intruders,\\u2019 \\u2024 as well as the power to do so.\\u201d (quoting Osage Nation of Indians v. United States, 19 Ind. Cl. Comm. 447, 489 (1968))). The Court of Claims has explained that [i]mplicit in the concept of ownership of property is the right to exclude others. Generally speaking, a true owner of land exercises full dominion and control over it; a true owner possesses the right to expel intruders\\u2024 True ownership of land by a tribe is called in question where the historical record of the region indicates that it was inhabited, controlled or wandered over by many tribes or groups. Ordinarily, where two or more tribes inhabit an area no tribe will satisfy the requirement of showing such \\u201cexclusive\\u201d use \\u2024 United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1394 (quoted by the United States Court of Federal Claims\\u2009 in Wichita Indian Tribe v. United States, 696 F.2d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 1983)). 368.\\u2003The Court of Federal Claims has noted that \\u201cthe general rule of exclusive use and occupancy is subject to three exceptions: (1) the joint-and-amicableuse exception; (2) the dominated use exception; and (3) the permissive use exception.\\u201d Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas v. United States, No. 3-83, 2000 WL 1013532, at *12 (Fed. Cl. June 19, 2000). The joint-and-amicable use exception provides that \\u201ctwo or more tribes or groups might inhabit an area in \\u2018joint and amicable\\u2019 possession without erasing the \\u2018exclusive\\u2019 nature of their use and occupancy,\\u201d and without interrupting establishment of aboriginal title. Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 561 (quoting United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1394). \\u201cTo qualify for treatment under \\u2018joint and amicable\\u2019 occupancy, the relationship of the Indian groups must be extremely close.\\u201d Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 561. The Court of Claims described such a relationship in Sac & Fox Tribe v. United States: Originally the Sac and Fox Nation consisted of two separate and identifiable tribes of Indians belonging to the Algonquin stock. Around 1735, due to their mutual hostility and conflict with the French, they formed a close and intimate alliance, politically and socially, so that from thence forward they have been dealt with and referred to as a single nation both in their relationship with other Indian tribes and in treaty negotiations and other matters with the United States. 383 F.2d at 995. Although the joint possessors must show their relationship is a \\u201cclose and intimate alliance, politically and socially,\\u201d Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 562, it is not necessary for the Tribes to show that they are completely merged, see United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1395 (\\u201cThere are no holdings of this court which say that two Indian tribes or groups, each a separate \\u2018entity\\u2019 and each with its own separate lands, can never assert joint ownership to other lands which are commonly used and occupied.\\u201d). For example, the evidence in United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso shows that two Indian groups objectively believed that they shared common ownership of the land \\u201cin joint tenancy under a 1770 land grant from the Spanish Crown,\\u201d and the court held that the Tribes used and occupied the land in joint-and-amicable possession. See United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1395-96. The joint-and-amicable use exception does not apply, however, when \\u201ceach tribe had separate lands, [and] there was no community of interest in the lands,\\u201d because [t]he [Tribes] did not consider themselves, and were not treated, as a single or closely integrated entity, but rather as separate political groups which were friends or allies (for the most part). Their use of the same lands may have been in common, like much of Indian use of the midwestern and western regions -- but the Commission could properly decide that it was not proved to be truly joint, and therefore that each separate tribe's claim to Indian title would have to be tested on its own distinct basis. Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 562. Thus, mere cooperation among two or more Tribes is insufficient to prove joint-and-amicable possession. See Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 562. 369.\\u2003The dominant-use exception to the exclusive use rule recognizes that, where another Tribe commonly uses the land with the claimant Tribe, proof of the claimant Tribe's dominance over the other Tribe preserves its exclusive use of the land. See United States v. Seminole Indians of Fla., 180 Ct. Cl. at 383-86. The claimant Tribe's dominance illustrates its ability to exclude other Tribes from the area, even if it never chooses to exercise that ability. See United States v. Seminole Indians of Fla., 180 Ct. Cl. at 383. In United States v. Seminole Indians of Florida, for example, the Court of Claims explained that the Seminole Indians obtained aboriginal title to the Florida peninsula, notwithstanding the presence of other Indian tribes, because there was little question that, in their occupation of the land, the Seminoles held a virtual \\u201cmonopoly.\\u201d While expert witnesses concede the contemporaneous existence of other Indians in Florida \\u2024 these scattered groupings were few and far between, and the record offers no evidence to suggest that Seminole dominion was ever challenged by these vestiges of aboriginal cultures. Instead, the pattern that prevailed was one of cultural assimilation -- the Seminoles simply absorbing these \\u201cforeign\\u201d elements into their own ranks. United States v. Seminole Indians of Fla., 180 Ct. Cl. at 383. Thus, the dominant-use exception prevails in situations where one Tribe culturally assimilates another Tribe or otherwise exercises complete dominion over \\u201cscattered groupings\\u201d of other Indians that appear \\u201cfew and far between.\\u201d United States v. Seminole Indians of Fla., 180 Ct. Cl. at 383. 370.\\u2003The permissive-use exception to the exclusive use rule acknowledges that other Indian Tribes could have \\u201crang[ed] over large portions\\u201d of the claimant Tribe's land without defeating the exclusive nature of the claimant Tribe's use, as long as the other Tribes' presence was with the claimant Tribe's permission. Wichita Indian Tribe v. United States, 696 F.2d at 1385. The United States Court of Federal Claims in Wichita Indian Tribe v. United States explained that, in light of the other Tribes' friendly relations and trading activities, it required more specific evidence than that of shared hunting grounds to \\u201cjustify a finding of a lack of exclusive use of all the Texas lands.\\u201d 696 F.2d at 1385. Similarly, in Spokane Tribe of Indians v. United States, the Court of Claims admonished the ICC to \\u201cadequately consider whether [the] use by other Indians was by permission and at the sufferance of the [claimant Tribe], or as a matter of right; if the former, the alien visits would not diminish the appellant's Indian title.\\u201d Spokane Tribe of Indians v. United States, 163 Ct. Cl. at 68-69. In Strong v. United States, the Court of Claims affirmed the ICC's finding that the claimant Tribe's presence was \\u201coverwhelmingly predominant and lasted a long time. Those incidents of use and occupancy by other Indians [the Court of Claims views] as permissive or as so sporadic as not to be inconsistent with [the claimant tribe's] use and occupancy.\\u201d Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 565. To satisfy the permissive use exception, permission need not be explicit, but may be inferred from the record as a whole. See Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 572. The Court of Claims in Strong v. United States found that a Tribe other than the claimant Tribe had two settlements in the claim area and inferred permissive use, stating that [t]here is evidence that the Wyandot had given permission to other Indian tribes to use their lands in Ohio, and we think the record, taken as a whole, supports the inference that the Ottawa were in the Sandusky area with the consent of the Wyandot. Permissive use by the Ottawa did not diminish the title of the Wyandot, and by the same token, such use gave the Ottawa no interest in the land. Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 572. 371.\\u2003The Court of Federal Claims has noted that \\u201ca claimant tribe's non-exclusive use of one segment of the claim area is not automatically imputed to the whole claim area.\\u201d Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas v. United States, 2000 WL 1013532, at *14. See Wichita Indian Tribe v. United States, 696 F.2d at 1385 (finding that the \\u201csphere of Osage influence capable of disrupting the Wichitas' exclusivity of use \\u2024 did not extend to the southern border of Oklahoma.\\u201d). Thus, a court may find that a claimant Tribe had exclusive use of certain portions of the claim area, but failed to prove exclusive use of other portions. See e.g., Sac & Fox Tribe of Indians of Okl. v. United States, 315 F.2d at 901-06; Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 565-69. 372.\\u2003When disputes require the Supreme Court to determine the extent of Tribal lands, the Supreme Court applies the canons of construction applicable to treaties with Indian nations and to statutes regulating Indian affairs. See, e.g., Choctaw Nation of Indians v. United States, 318 U.S. 423, 431-32, 63 S.Ct. 672, 87 L.Ed. 877 (1943). The Supreme Court and the federal Courts of Appeals have also resolved Tribal boundary disputes by applying general rules for resolution of ambiguities of deeds and patents. See, e.g., Meigs v. M'Clung's Lessee, 13 U.S. (9 Cranch) 11, 17-18, 3 L.Ed. 639 (1815)(holding that unilateral action of United States' agents cannot give meaning to bilateral treaty); City of New Town v. United States, 454 F.2d 121, 125 (8th Cir. 1972)(holding that administrative action may not alter an Indian reservation's boundaries). Although the Secretary of the Interior has no inherent authority to resolve Tribal boundary disputes, courts have given significant weight to administrative recognition of Tribal boundaries. See, e.g., DeCoteau v. Dist. Cty. Court, 420 U.S. 425, 442-44, 95 S.Ct. 1082, 43 L.Ed.2d 300 (1975)(citing DOI opinion as support for determination of reservation borders). Cf. Op. Sol. Interior, M-36539 (Nov. 19, 1958)(\\u201cIn determining the boundaries of an Indian reservation[,] the recognition by the Interior Department of a boundary as such for many years will be deemed controlling.\\u201d); Op. Sol. Interior, 57 Interior Dec. 219 (1940)(granting authority to enter into agreement fixing boundaries of allotted and ceded Tribal lands). Errors in United States' land surveys, however, are a recurring source of Tribal land claims. See, e.g., Or. Dep't of Fish & Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, 473 U.S. 753, 756-57, 105 S.Ct. 3420, 87 L.Ed.2d 542 (1985); Creek Nation v. United States, 302 U.S. 620, 58 S.Ct. 384, 82 L.Ed. 482 (1938); Pueblo of Sandia v. Babbitt, 231 F.3d 878 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Seminole Nation v. United States, 102 Ct. Cl. 565, 618-21 (1944); Pueblo of Taos v. Andrus, 475 F. Supp. 359 (D.D.C. 1979)(Gasch, J.). 3.\\u2003Extinguishment of Aboriginal Title. 373.\\u2003The basic rule governing alienation of American Indian land is that only the United States can extinguish aboriginal title. See 25 U.S.C. \\u00a7 177. See also 25 C.F.R. \\u00a7 152.22(b); Santa Fe, 314 at 347. The United States holds most Tribal property in trust. See Cohen's Handbook, supra note 189, at 997-99. The United States, or the state government in the case of the original thirteen states, holds the \\u201cfee\\u201d interest -- the right of preemption -- while the Tribe holds the \\u201ctitle of occupancy\\u201d or beneficial title. Cohen's Handbook, supra note 189, \\u00a7 15.03 at 997-99. The Supreme Court has held that, although the sovereign can alienate the right of preemption without Tribal consent, only Congress, or a presidential act ratified by Congress, can extinguish aboriginal title, no matter which sovereign holds the right of preemption. Buttz v. Northern Pac. R.R., 119 U.S. at 65, 7 S.Ct. 100. Thus, the exclusive right to extinguish aboriginal title rests with the United States. See Oneida Indian Nation v. Cty. of Oneida, 414 U.S. at 667, 94 S.Ct. 772 (\\u201cOnce the United States was organized and the Constitution adopted, these tribal rights to Indian lands became the exclusive province of the federal law. Indian title, recognized to be only a right of occupancy, was extinguishable only by the United States.\\u201d); Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 347, 62 S.Ct. 248; Buttz v. Northern Pac. R.R., 119 U.S. at 68, 7 S.Ct. 100; Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. at 586. 374.\\u2003Although the principle that the United States has the exclusive power to extinguish aboriginal title has remained unchanged, the Supreme Court unequivocally has rejected the view that the process by which the United States extinguishes title is nonjusticiable: [I]t seems that the Court's conclusive presumption of congressional good faith [in Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock] was based in large measure on the idea that relations between this Nation and the Indian tribes are a political matter, not amenable to judicial review. That view, of course, has long since been discredited in takings cases. United States v. Sioux Nation, 448 U.S. 371, 413, 100 S.Ct. 2716, 65 L.Ed.2d 844 (1980)(citing Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, 187 U.S. 553, 565, 23 S.Ct. 216, 47 L.Ed. 299 (1903)). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court continues to state that Congress is authorized to extinguish aboriginal title when it chooses to do so, notwithstanding treaty promises to the contrary. See, e.g., Idaho v. United States, 533 U.S. 262, 277, 121 S.Ct. 2135, 150 L.Ed.2d 326 (2001); United States v. Sioux Nation, 448 U.S. at 415 n.29, 100 S.Ct. 2716. 375.\\u2003Moreover, because aboriginal title is based on proof of continuous possession, a number of cases have held Tribal abandonment can result in the loss of aboriginal title, but only if such abandonment is voluntary. See Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 349, 62 S.Ct. 248; Williams v. City of Chicago, 242 U.S. 434, 438, 37 S.Ct. 142, 61 L.Ed. 414 (1917); Buttz v. Northern Pac. R.R., 119 U.S. at 55, 7 S.Ct. 100. Rather than serving as the basis for title extinguishment, voluntary abandonment most frequently figures in disputes over which of two Tribes owns disputed territory. See Six Nations v. United States, 173 Ct. Cl. 899, 899 (1965). Notably, as discussed above, the Court of Claims repeatedly has held that claims of aboriginal title may survive evidence of joint ownership by two or more tribes. See, e.g., United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1395; Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 561; United States v. Seminole Indians of Fla., 180 Ct. Cl. at 383-86. 376.\\u2003Although Congress has the power to extinguish aboriginal title, intent to do so must be \\u201cplain and unambiguous,\\u201d and will not be \\u201clightly implied.\\u201d Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 346, 354, 62 S.Ct. 248. The Supreme Court consistently holds that Congress' intent to extinguish aboriginal title must be express on the face of the legislative act or treaty authorizing extinguishment, or be clear from the surrounding circumstances. See, e.g., Mattz v. Arnett, 412 U.S. 481, 505, 93 S.Ct. 2245, 37 L.Ed.2d 92, (1973); Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 353-54, 62 S.Ct. 248; Jones v. Meehan, 175 U.S. 1, 1, 20 S.Ct. 1, 44 L.Ed. 49 (1899). Indeed, most federal land grants explicitly provide that the grantee cannot take possession until aboriginal title is extinguished. See, e.g., Oneida Indian Nation of New York v. New York, 691 F.2d at 1075 (\\u201cUntil Indian title is extinguished by sovereign act, any holder of the fee title or right of preemption, either through discovery or a grant from or succession to the discovering sovereign, remains subject \\u2024 to the Indian right of occupancy, and the Indians may not be ejected.\\u201d); Buttz v. Northern Pac. R.R., 119 U.S. at 68, 7 S.Ct. 100 (railroad grant provided for extinguishment of aboriginal title by government \\u201cas rapidly as might be consistent with public policy and the welfare of the Indians\\u201d). In ambiguous cases regarding the interpretation of statutes and treaties that arguably extinguished aboriginal title, the federal courts have applied the Indian law canon that Tribal property rights are preserved unless Congress's intent to the contrary is clear and unambiguous. See, e.g., Cty. of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation, 470 U.S. at 246-47, 105 S.Ct. 1245 (interpreting federally approved treaties ceding additional land to New York as not sufficiently clear to extinguish title to land in question); Cramer v. United States, 261 U.S. at 227, 43 S.Ct. 342 (interpreting exception in grant to railroad for lands \\u201cotherwise disposed of\\u201d to include lands occupied by Indians, in light of federal policy \\u201cfrom the beginning to respect the Indian right of occupancy\\u201d); Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1164 (rejecting United States' argument that aboriginal title is extinguished if federal land grant does not contain \\u201clanguage that the grant was subject to pre-existing interests,\\u201d and affirming that \\u201cfederal land grants pass fee title to the grantees subject to aboriginal title\\u201d). See also Cohen's Handbook, supra note 189, \\u00a7 2.02[1], at 113 (\\u201cThe basic Indian law canons of construction require that treaties, agreements, statutes, and executive orders be liberally construed in favor of the Indians and that all ambiguities are to be resolved in their favor.\\u201d). 377.\\u2003Notwithstanding the requirement that only Congress can extinguish aboriginal title, the Supreme Court has held that payment of a judgment rendered in a claim for damages is sufficient to effect extinguishment. See United States v. Dann, 470 U.S. at 45-50, 105 S.Ct. 1058. Moreover, several courts have held that Congressional acts in anticipation of settlement and public use, and actual settlement, by non-Indians are factors that may effect aboriginal title extinguishment. See, e.g., United States v. Gemmill, 535 F.2d at 1147; United States v Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1391; Gila River Pima-Maricopa Indian Cmty. v. United States, 494 F.2d at 1386; Plamondon ex rel. Cowlitz Tribe of Indians v. United States, 467 F.2d 935, 937 (Ct. Cl. 1972). 378.\\u2003In Plamondon ex rel. Cowlitz Tribe of Indians v. United States, the Court of Claims, when tasked with deciding only whether the lands in question were taken in 1855 or 1863, explained first that the limited settlement by non-Indians on the Cowlitz land up to 1855 was not sufficient to extinguish the Tribe's aboriginal title; settlement was minimal and did not disrupt the Cowlitz Tribe's way of life, and, in fact, land patents were not issued to claimants on Cowlitz Tribal lands until several years after 1855. See 467 F.2d at 937-38. By 1863, the Court of Claims found, however, that non-Indians had substantially settled the Cowlitz Tribal land, that the non-Indians greatly outnumbered the Indians, that the Indians intermingled with the non-Indians and no longer maintained an independent existence, and that they were thus deprived of the exclusive use and occupancy of their aboriginal lands. See 467 F.2d at 936-37. This finding, when combined with the establishment of a reservation for the Cowlitz, and evidence of Congressional intent to foreclose treaty negotiations and subject the Cowlitz land to public sale, led the Court of Claims to affirm the ICC's finding of an 1863 taking date. See 467 F.2d at 937. 379.\\u2003Additional Court of Claims support for aboriginal title extinguishment absent express Congressional intent is seen in Gila River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community v. United States, wherein American Indian claimants -- who had conceded before the ICC that their aboriginal title was extinguished -- argued that, until the enactment of the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934, the settlers' individual entries effected the only extinguishment of aboriginal title to the claimed lands, tract by tract, onto the land in the ICC award area. See 494 F.2d at 1392. In considering the date at which extinguishment occurred, the Court of Claims stated that the ICC was faced with a difficult task. Unlike some other cases, there was here no formal cession by the Indians, no express indication by Congress (or its delegate) of a purpose to extinguish at a specified time, and no single act (or contemporaneous series of acts) of the Federal Government which indisputably erased native ownership at one swoop. The Indian appellants say that, in these circumstances, the presumption of the Santa Fe opinion requires the tribunal to hold that there was no general taking at all until some unequivocal action by Congress (such as, they concede but only arguendo, the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934). We think, however, that this is a case in which the history of the award area is such that the Commission could permissibly stop short of an uncontroverted and unmistakable sign from Congress. 494 F.2d at 1392. The Court of Claims found that the ICC had the discretion to choose, as the taking date, an Executive Order issued in 1883, which doubled the size of the existing reservation, because the Executive Order indicated that the United States believed that all the rightful Tribal land was now within the reservations and that the 1883 extension was an effort to keep for the Indians the lands that they were then occupying and using. See 494 F.2d at 1392 (\\u201cAt that moment, it could be said, the Government called a final halt because in its eyes the Pima-Maricopa group did not own the territory outside of the reservation, and any Indian claim to it was and should be rejected.\\u201d). Thus, the Court of Claims affirmed the ICC's conclusion that the extent of non-Indian settlement, coupled with an Executive Order that Congress \\u201cimpliedly ratified,\\u201d marked the extinguishment of aboriginal title to all of the Tribe's outlying lands. 494 F.2d at 1394 (\\u201cIn the context of this history, it is proper to imply a Congressional delegation of some of its plenary power over Pima-Maricopa affairs to the executive branch.\\u201d). 380.\\u2003The claim for failure to protect aboriginal title in United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso arose after the United States created a reservation for thirteen Pueblos on their historic lands, included other Tribal lands in a national forest reserve, and, over many years, granted the Pueblos' remaining lands to non-Indian settlers under the public land laws. See 513 F.2d at 1383. The Court of Claims concluded that the reservation's creation by itself was not sufficient to extinguish Tribal title to lands not included in the reservation borders. See 513 F.2d at 1388. Extinguishment occurred only when federal land laws granted non-Indians the right to settle particular lands. See 513 F.2d at 1391. The United States argued that substantial \\u201cnon-Indian interference with [the Indians'] exclusive use and occupancy of aboriginal land title areas\\u201d extinguished Tribal title. 513 F.2d at 1386-87. The Court of Claims rejected the argument that non-Indian encroachment could result in the loss of aboriginal title when the affected tribe did not voluntarily abandon the land, see 513 F.2d at 1390, and affirmed that private individuals' actions cannot affect aboriginal title, see 513 F.2d at 1387 (\\u201c[T]ermination of Indian title is exclusively the province of the United States.\\u201d). The Court of Claims held that there must be \\u201cclear and convincing evidence of an intent to extinguish\\u201d aboriginal title and that \\u201cthe fact that some entries [by non-Indians] were allowed in the plaintiffs' aboriginal areas is evidence of official negligence, or lack of knowledge of the plaintiffs' areas, rather than an intent on the part of the United States to abolish their whole titles.\\u201d 513 F.2d at 1390. Nevertheless, the Court of Claims affirmed the ICC extinguishment award based on the dates when the aboriginal areas were included in what later became the Santa Fe National Forest and when individual non-Indian settlers entered Tribal lands under the public land laws, concluding that there are no fine spun or precise formulas for determining the end of aboriginal ownership. Unquestionably, the impact of authorized white settlement upon the Indian way of life in aboriginal areas may serve as an important indicator of when aboriginal title was lost. But such authorized settlement is only one of various factors to be considered in determining when specific lands were \\u201ctaken.\\u201d Gila River, supra, 494 F.2d at 1391, 204 Ct. Cl. at 146. United States v Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1390. See generally Tlingit & Haida Indians v. United States, 177 F. Supp. 452 (Ct. Cl. 1959)(holding that the establishment of forest reserves constituted a taking of land which the claimant Indians historically used and occupied); Pueblo of Nambe v. United States, 16 Ind. Cl. Comm. 393 (1965)(same); Pueblo of Taos, 15 Ind. Cl. Comm. 666 (1965)(same). 381.\\u2003In United States v. Gemmill -- the only United States Court of Appeals case to consider factors other than express Congressional intent as evidence of aboriginal title extinguishment -- members of the Pit River Indian Tribe were arrested for trespass and theft of United States government property after they removed Christmas trees from the Shasta Trinity National Forest. See 535 F.2d at 1149. Other Tribal members were arrested for trespass when they sought to stop logging in the Lassen National Forrest, which the members considered sacred Tribal lands. See 535 F.2d at 1147. The members contended that their Tribe possessed unextinguished aboriginal title to the land in question; however, the Ninth Circuit concluded that four events taken together demonstrated Congressional intent sufficient to extinguish their Tribe's aboriginal title. See 535 F.2d at 1149. The first event was passage of the California Land Claims Act of 1851, Act of March 3, 1851, ch. 41, 9 Stat. 631 (\\u201cCalifornia Land Act\\u201d), which required all persons claiming lands by virtue of Spanish or Mexican title grants to present their claims to a special commission or lose their rights. See 535 F.2d at 1148. Although Tribal claims were based on aboriginal possession and occupancy, rather than a grant from Spain or Mexico, the Supreme Court interpreted the statute as requiring the Indians in the area to present their claims to the federal government. See 535 F.2d at 1148 (\\u201cIn Barker v. Harvey \\u2024 and United States v. Title Ins. & Trust Co. \\u2024, the Supreme Court upheld fee titles based on\\u00b7 patents against challenges by Mission Indians who had not presented their claims to the 1851 Commission\\u201d). Thus, a federal statute interpreted by the Supreme Court constituted sufficient Congressional intent to extinguish aboriginal title when the Tribes in question failed to comply with the statutory claim procedures. See 535 F.2d at 1148. 382.\\u2003Second, the United States engaged in prolonged military confrontation with the Pit River Indians in the 1850s and 1860s, which culminated in a decisive military defeat in 1867. See 535 F.2d at 1148. The United States then removed the Pit River Indians from their lands by force. See 535 F.2d at 1149. Third, in another express act, the federal government included the lands in question in the Shasta Trinity and Lassen National Forests. See 535 F.2d at 1149 (citing the Court of Claims' holding in United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso that the designation of land as a forest reserve is itself effective to extinguish aboriginal title). Fourth, the Tribe brought a damages claim against the United States before the ICC for taking its lands, and the ICC awarded the Tribe compensation. See 535 F.2d at 1149 (citing Pit River Indians v. United States, 7 Ind. Cl. Comm. 815). In concluding that the Tribe previously had acknowledged the extinction of its aboriginal title, the Ninth Circuit opined: The exact date on which Indian title has been extinguished is often difficult to determine. (See United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, supra, at 1391,.) The four events we have recounted amply illustrate that problem. Any one of these actions, examined in isolation, may not provide an unequivocal answer to the question of extinguishment. However, the activity of the federal government, beginning with the ambiguous Act of 1851 and culminating in the payment of the compromise settlement, has included expulsion by force, inconsistent use, and voluntary payment of compensation agreement. (See Santa Fe, supra, 314 U.S. at 347, 62 S.Ct. 248 \\u2024) This century-long course of conduct amply demonstrates that the Pit River Indian title has been extinguished. United States v. Gemmill, 535 F.2d at 1149. ANALYSIS 383.\\u2003The Court concludes that no federal rule of procedure nor the doctrine of laches or any statute of limitations bar Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim to the Valles Caldera. Moreover, the Court will not invoke judicial estoppel to preclude the United States' argument that Jemez Pueblo does not possess aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera. The Court further concludes that Jemez Pueblo has not established aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera. Although the evidence proves that Jemez Pueblo has actually and continuously used the Valles Caldera for a long time, the evidence also shows that many Pueblos and Tribes also used the Valles Caldera in ways that defeat Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim.

Ctr., 94 F.3d 1407, 1411 (10th Cir. 1996)(indicating that a court must determine whether the party in question is necessary under rule 19(a) before proceeding to decide whether the party is indispensable under rule 19(b)). Rule 19(a) defines those persons who should be joined as parties to an action and thus are considered necessary parties to the action: A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of jurisdiction over the subject matter of the action shall be joined as a party in the action if (1) in the person's absence complete relief cannot be accorded among those already parties, or (2) the person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the person's absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect that interest or (ii) leave any of the persons already parties subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations by reason of the claimed interest. Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a). 385.\\u2003The Court declines to adopt the United States' argument that, because Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera claim threatens the Pueblos of Cochiti, San Ildefonso, Santa Clara, Zia, and the Jicarilla Apache Nation's many long-standing cultural and religious interests in the Valles Caldera, including their ability to continue to worship on Redondo Peak, these Pueblos are required parties to this litigation. The first consideration under rule 19(a) is whether, in these Pueblos' absence, the Court could afford complete relief to Jemez Pueblo. The Court answers this inquiry in the affirmative, because these Pueblos' absence does not prevent the Court from according \\u201ccomplete relief among existing parties,\\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1)(A), given that Jemez Pueblo has sued the Valles Caldera's present fee holder, the United States, and, that, as the Court has previously noted, the Indian lands exception to the QTA precludes the Court from entering judgment that would affect Santa Clara Pueblo's conservation and access easement, see SJ Order at 7 (citing Block v. North Dakota, 461 U.S. at 275-76, 103 S.Ct. 1811) (affirming that, pursuant to the QTA, the United States does not waive sovereign immunity where the land either is held in \\u201ctrust or [is] restricted Indian lands\\u201d). Moreover, Jemez Pueblo has represented to the Court that it \\u201cdoes not make any claim to the land transferred by the Dunigans to Santa Clara Pueblo, or the reciprocal easement transferred by the Dunigans directly to Santa Clara Pueblo,\\u201d Response at 33, and the Court, therefore, is \\u201cnot persuaded that there is a likelihood of further lawsuits \\u2018involving essentially the same subject matter,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Sac & Fox Nation of Missouri v. Norton, 240 F.3d at 1258 (quoting 7 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \\u00a7 1604, at 45-46 (2d ed. 1986)(\\u201cFederal Practice and Procedure\\u201d)). 386.\\u2003The second consideration under rule 19(a) is whether the other Pueblos have an interest relating to this action's subject matter, and, if so, whether this action's disposition in the other Pueblos' absence may, as a practical matter, impair their ability to protect that interest, or subject either Jemez Pueblo or the United States to a substantial risk of inconsistent obligations. Neither Jemez Pueblo nor the United States dispute that other Pueblos have interests in this action's outcome, specifically continued interests in accessing the Valles Caldera and worshiping on Redondo Peak. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 315-16, 319-21, 329, 341-44, 347-429, 528-30, 534-35, 535 n.170, at 138-39, 140-41, 146-47, 152-55, 157-205, 232-35, 237. The United States' presence as defendant, however, greatly reduces the potential prejudice to these other Pueblos' interests. As a practical matter, the United States' interest in defending its title to the Valles Caldera is \\u201cvirtually identical\\u201d to that of these other Pueblos. Rishell v. Jane Phillips Episcopal Mem'l Med. Ctr., 94 F.3d at 1411. See Washington v. Daley, 173 F.3d 1158, 1167-68 (9th Cir. 1999)(concluding that Indian Tribes were not necessary parties to actions filed by State of Washington against Secretary of Commerce challenging regulation allocating groundfish catches to Tribes, inasmuch as the Secretary and the Tribes had virtually identical interests and the United States could therefore adequately represent the Tribes); 3A James Moore, Moore's Federal Practice \\u00b6 19.07[2.1], at 19-106 (2d ed. 1995)(\\u201c[T]he fact that the absent person may be bound by the judgment does not of itself require his joinder if his interests are fully represented by parties present.\\u201d). Trial establishes that these Pueblos' interests in the Valles Caldera are so aligned with the United States' interests to affirm the Court's prediction \\u201cthat the United States will robustly defend against Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim, and thereby defend the Pueblo of Santa Clara's interests in the United States' continued stewardship of the Valles Caldera.\\u201d SJ Order at 7. See Davis v. United States, 343 F.3d at 1291-92 (\\u201cWe note that in some cases the interests of the absent person are so aligned with those of one or more parties that the absent person's interests are, as a practical matter, protected.\\u201d). For example, at trial, the United States presented testimony from members of Santa Clara Pueblo and Zia Pueblo, and, although these members' religious traditions prevented them from providing specific details about their respective Pueblo's Valles Caldera use, they nonetheless answered many questions regarding their respective Pueblo's interest in the United States' continued Valles Caldera stewardship. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 349-409, at 158-191. Furthermore, the Court is not convinced that these Pueblos' absence would subject either party to this suit to a substantial risk of multiple or inconsistent obligations. As noted above, nothing in the record indicates the possibility of additional lawsuits involving this same subject matter. See Sac & Fox Nation of Missouri v. Norton, 240 F.3d at 1259 (citing 7 Federal Practice and Procedure \\u00a7 1604, at 62 (\\u201cThe key is whether the possibility of being subject to multiple obligations is real; an unsubstantiated or speculative risk will not satisfy the Rule 19(a) criteria.\\u201d)). 387.\\u2003Even assuming that other Pueblos could be considered necessary parties under rule 19(a), the Court is not persuaded that these other Pueblos are indispensable parties under rule 19(b). A necessary party can be considered an indispensable party only if, \\u201cin equity and good conscience,\\u201d a court should not allow the action to proceed in the party's absence. Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b). To make this determination, the Court must balance the following four factors set forth in rule 19(b): [F]irst, to what extent a judgment rendered in the person's absence might be prejudicial to the person or those already parties; second, the extent to which, by protective provisions in the judgment, by the shaping of relief, or other measures, the prejudice can be lessened or avoided; third, whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence will be adequate; fourth, whether the plaintiff will have an adequate remedy if the action is dismissed for nonjoinder. Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b). Applying these factors, the Court concludes that other Pueblos are not indispensable parties. With respect to the first factor, it is true that the other Pueblos have substantial interests in continued access to the Valles Caldera; however, as previously noted, the United States' interest in defending its title to those lands offsets the potential of prejudice to other Pueblos' interests, which the Court concludes are substantially similar, if not virtually identical, to those of the United States. Because the potential for prejudice is minimal, the Court \\u201cneed not be concerned with the second factor, which addresses the availability of means for lessening or avoiding prejudice.\\u201d Rishell v. Jane Phillips Episcopal Mem'l Med. Ctr., 94 F.3d at 1412. With respect to the third factor, a judgment rendered in the other Pueblos' absence would be adequate in the Court's view because, regardless these Pueblos' presence or absence, the Court, as noted above, can grant the relief that Jemez Pueblo requests in the Complaint. Finally, and perhaps most important, there is no alternative forum in which Jemez Pueblo's QTA action can be heard; hence, this action is the only opportunity for Jemez Pueblo to challenge the United States' title to the Valles Caldera. See Sac & Fox Nation of Missouri v. Norton, 240 F.3d at 1260 (citing Kescoli v. Babbitt, 101 F.3d 1304, 1311 (9th Cir. 1996)(noting that a court should be \\u201cextra cautious\\u201d before dismissing an action pursuant to rule 19(b) if no alternative forum exists); Rishell v. Jane Phillips Episcopal Mem'l Med. Ctr., 94 F.3d at 1413 (noting that \\u201c[t]he absence of an alternative forum would weigh heavily, if not conclusively against dismissal\\u201d)). The Court, therefore, declines to adopt the United States' position that the Pueblos of Cochiti, San Ildefonso, Santa Clara, Zia, and the Jicarilla Apache Nation's absence is sufficient to compel the Court to dismiss Jemez Pueblo's QTA action under rule 19. II.\\u2003THE ICCA'S STATUTES OF LIMITATION DO NOT BAR JEMEZ PUEBLO'S ABORIGINAL TITLE CLAIM. 388.\\u2003In 1946, Congress enacted the ICCA to \\u201cdispose of the Indian claims problem with finality\\u201d and to \\u201ctransfer from Congress to the Indian Claims Commission the responsibility for determining the merits of Native American claims.\\u201d United States v. Dann, 470 U.S. at 45, 105 S.Ct. 1058. The ICCA gave the ICC \\u201csweeping\\u201d authority to consider \\u201call possible accrued claims\\u201d against the United States, including claims \\u201cof a purely moral nature,\\u201d Navajo Tribe of Indians v. State of N.M., 809 F.2d at 1464-65, and imposed a five-year statute of limitations period \\u201con Indian claims in law and equity then existing and arising under the Constitution, federal law, and treaties between Indian tribes and the United States,\\u201d Oglala Sioux Tribe of Pine Ridge Indian Reservation v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 570 F.3d 327, 331 (D.C. Cir. 2009); ICCA \\u00a7 12. \\u201cCongress deliberately used broad terminology in the Act in order to permit tribes to bring all potential historical claims and to thereby prevent them from returning to Congress to lobby for further redress.\\u201d Oglala Sioux Tribe of Pine Ridge Indian Reservation v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 570 F.3d at 331. The ICCA, however, only \\u201cbars claims involving allotments or other property, claims involving title, claims to equitable relief, claims for damages, and related constitutional and procedural claims that accrued before 1946 and were not brought by August 13, 1951.\\u201d Oglala Sioux Tribe of Pine Ridge Indian Reservation v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 570 F.3d at 331-32. The ICCA also provides that \\u201cpayment of any claim\\u201d discharged \\u201call claims and demands touching any of the matters involved in the controversy.\\u201d ICCA \\u00a7 22. Moreover, ICCA \\u00a7 24, now codified at 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1505, vests in the Court of Claims and its successor court, the Court of Federal Claims, jurisdiction over \\u201cany claim against the United States accruing after August 13, 1946, in favor of any tribe,\\u201d including claims for the land takings, 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1505, and 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2501 precludes petitioners from bringing such claims against the United States unless the \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018petition is filed within six years after such claim first accrues,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U.S. 130, 132, 128 S.Ct. 750, 169 L.Ed.2d 591 (2008)(quoting 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2501 (\\u201cEvery claim of which the United States Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction shall be barred unless the petition thereon is filed within six years after such claim first accrues.\\u201d)). 389.\\u2003The Court declines to adopt the United States' position that the Valles Caldera's private owners' pre-1946 interference with Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal uses is sufficiently substantial to trigger the ICCA statutes of limitation to which the Tenth Circuit refers as a potential bar to Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera claim. See supra COLs \\u00b6\\u00b6 194-95, at 350-51 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166; id. at 1168) (\\u201cOn the present record, we cannot say that either the Baca grant or use of the land by the Baca heirs or their successors establish as matter of law that the Jemez Pueblo had a pre-1946 claim against the government under the ICCA.\\u201d). The trial establishes that Jemez Pueblo actually and continuously used the Valles Caldera, despite the private owners' restrictions, and that such use has continued through the present. These record facts demonstrate that no substantial interference occurred sufficient to cause Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim to the Valles Caldera to accrue before 1946. Moreover, the United States has not persuaded the Court that the private owner's restrictions \\u201cinvolve some action on the part of Congress, either directly or through the President, that significantly affects an Indian Tribe's use of its historic lands.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 118, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1119. 390.\\u2003The Court declines to adopt the United States' argument that, because the Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana, and Zia presented before the ICC evidence that they used a portion of the Valles Caldera in common, including Redondo Peak, Jemez Pueblo's ICC judgment precludes its claim here. See supra COLs \\u00b6\\u00b6 194-95, at 350-51. Both this Court and the Tenth Circuit have evaluated this argument fully, and the Court agrees with the Tenth Circuit that the United States' \\u201cres judicata argument fails because the Jemez Pueblo's current claim is a quiet title action to establish that its aboriginal title to different land has not been extinguished.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1171. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 9, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1061 (\\u201cBaca Location No. 1, which included the area of the Valles Caldera, was not the subject of [Zia I-IV].\\u201d). The trial presents no new facts or argument that upsets the Court's prior conclusion. 391.\\u2003The United States' argument that Jemez Pueblo's statements before the ICC regarding joint use of areas within the Valles Caldera, including Redondo Peak, are per se sufficient to defeat Jemez Pueblo's claim, is similarly unpersuasive, see supra COLs \\u00b6\\u00b6 129, at 317, because Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title theory is that it satisfies the \\u201cexclusive use\\u201d requirement pursuant to one of the three established exceptions for joint-and-amicable, permissive, or dominant use, see supra FOFs \\u00b6 127 n.62, at 65; COLs \\u00b6\\u00b6 213, 224, 227, at 359-61, 363-64. Hence, the Court concludes that the fact that Jemez Pueblo representatives acknowledge using areas within the Valles Caldera jointly with other Pueblos is not sufficient, standing alone, to preclude an aboriginal title claim to the Valles Caldera. 392.\\u2003The Court also declines to adopt the United States' argument that Jemez Pueblo's admissions that it lost both use of and interest in the Valles Caldera between 1951 and 2000 represent claim accrual for statutory limitations purposes. See supra COLs \\u00b6 196, at 351. Although the record reflects that Jemez Pueblo made numerous statements regarding the effects that private ownership of its aboriginal territory had on Jemez Pueblo, including physical, spiritual, and psychological harm, see supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 211-26, 229-37, at 96-104, the record also reflects that, these comments aside, Jemez Pueblo never abandoned those lands, see supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 431-524, at 205-231. Accordingly, the Court concludes that, because Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use has continued unabated since time immemorial, Jemez Pueblo did not have a cognizable claim before the Court of Claims or its successor court, the Court of Federal Claims. III.\\u2003THE DOCTRINE OF LACHES DOES NOT BAR JEMEZ PUEBLO'S ABORIGINAL TITLE CLAIM. 393.\\u2003The doctrine of laches \\u201cbars a party's dilatory claim \\u2024 when there is: \\u2018(1) lack of diligence by the party against whom the defense is asserted, and (2) prejudice to the party asserting the defense.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Biodiversity Conservation All. v. Jiron, 762 F.3d 1036, 1090-91 (10th Cir. 2014)(quoting Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 122, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002)). \\u201cLaches is considered an equitable defense, controlled by equitable considerations. As with other equitable defenses, the existence of laches is a question primarily addressed to the discretion of the trial court.\\u201d Mile High Industries v. Cohen, 222 F.3d 845, 857 (10th Cir. 2000)(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). Laches applies only to claims for equitable relief, and, accordingly, \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018cannot be invoked to bar legal relief\\u2019 \\u2018[i]n the face of a statute of limitations enacted by Congress.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d SCA Hygiene Prod. Aktiebolag v. First Quality Baby Prod., LLC, \\u2013\\u2013\\u2013 U.S. \\u2013\\u2013\\u2013\\u2013, 137 S. Ct. 954, 959, 197 L.Ed.2d 292 (2017)(alterations in original)(quoting Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 572 U.S. 663, 679, 134 S.Ct. 1962, 188 L.Ed.2d 979 (2014)). See Oneida County, New York v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York State, 470 U.S. at 245 n.16, 105 S.Ct. 1245 (\\u201c[A]pplication of the equitable defense of laches in an action at law would be novel indeed.\\u201d). 394.\\u2003The Court declines to adopt the United States' argument that laches bars Jemez Pueblo's claim to the Valles Caldera, because Jemez Pueblo properly filed this action within the QTA's twelve-year limitations period. See United States v. Rodriguez-Aguirre, 264 F.3d at 1208 (\\u201cWhen a limitation on the period for bringing suit has been set by statute, laches will generally not be invoked to shorten the statutory period.\\u201d). The QTA provides that \\u201c[t]he United States may be named as a party defendant in a civil action under this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an interest,\\u201d and contains a twelve year statute of limitations which bars a party other than a state from filing suit unless \\u201cit is commenced within twelve years of the date upon which it accrued.\\u201d QTA \\u00a7 2409a(g). An action under the QTA accrues when the party \\u201cknew or should have known of the claim of the United States.\\u201d QTA \\u00a7 2409a(g). The United States does not dispute that Jemez Pueblo filed this action within twelve years of when, according to Jemez Pueblo, the claim accrued, but instead argues that the Court should apply laches because Jemez Pueblo's delay in filing its aboriginal title claim prejudices the United States, and other Pueblos and Tribes, given that the United States expended significant time and resources to acquire, restore, and maintain the Valles Caldera after other Pueblos and Tribes, including Jemez Pueblo, voiced strong support favoring United States' acquisition based on the understanding that the United States would adequately represent and protect their interests in the land. See COLs \\u00b6 291, at 349. 395.\\u2003The Court cannot soundly say, however, on the record before it, that Jemez Pueblo needlessly delayed in presenting its claim. Jemez Pueblo contends that its claim accrued only when the United States acquired an interest in the Valles Caldera in 2000 and thereafter began limiting Jemez Pueblo's access to the land in a manner inconsistent with its aboriginal title, see Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1151-52; Complaint \\u00b6 68, at 11 (\\u201cPrior to the establishment of the Valles Caldera National Preserve in 2000, the United States never opposed or interfered with Jemez Pueblo's continued traditional use and occupancy of the area of the Valles Caldera National Preserve pursuant to the Pueblo's aboriginal Indian title.\\u201d), and the Tenth Circuit specifically tasked the Court to determine \\u201cwhether, on remand, \\u2024 Jemez Pueblo can factually establish aboriginal possession to the land it claims,\\u201d thereby indicating that Jemez Pueblo's claim is properly before the Court, Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1163 n.15. The Court determined that the trial was necessary to resolve the factual disputes in this case, and although the Court in its findings concludes that Jemez Pueblo cannot satisfy the requirements necessary to prove aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera, the Court does not question Jemez Pueblo's belief that, since time immemorial, it has been the Valles Caldera's exclusive aboriginal user sufficient to satisfy the legal standard, and the Court will not foreclose Jemez Pueblo's efforts to prove that end. Accordingly, the Court stands by its previous ruling on this matter: [B]ecause Congress enacted a statute of limitations in the Quiet Title Act, because Jemez Pueblo brought this action pursuant to the statutory authority granted in the Quiet Title Act, and because Jemez Pueblo did so within the statutorily prescribed limitations period, this Court declines to apply laches to bar Jemez Pueblo's claim to the Valles Caldera. SJ Order at 7-8 (citing United States v. Rodriguez-Aguirre, 264 F.3d at 1208). IV.\\u2003THE COURT WILL NOT INVOKE JUDICIAL ESTOPPEL TO PRECLUDE THE UNITED STATES' ARGUMENT THAT JEMEZ PUEBLO DOES NOT POSSESS ABORIGINAL TITLE TO THE VALLES CALDERA. 396.\\u2003\\u201cThe doctrine of judicial estoppel is designed \\u2018to protect the integrity of the judicial process by prohibiting parties from deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the moment.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d BancInsure, Inc. v.

Although the circumstances in which judicial estoppel applies are \\u201cnot reducible to any general formulation of principle,\\u201d the Supreme Court, nevertheless, has identified three relevant factors: (i) whether a party's later position is \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018clearly inconsistent\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d with its former position; (ii) \\u201cwhether the party \\u2018succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d; and (iii) \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d BancInsure, Inc. v.

Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana & Zia v. Abousleman are not inconsistent. In United States ex rel. Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana & Zia v. Abousleman, the United States does not admit that Jemez Pueblo has or ever had title to the Valles Caldera, but instead asserts a legal argument that \\u201ca tribe's long, uninterrupted occupation of land gives rise to an aboriginal water right.\\u201d Supra FOFs \\u00b6 249, at 107-08. Moreover, the trial establishes that the United States' water rights claim on Jemez Pueblo's behalf in United States ex rel. Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana & Zia v. Abousleman does not include water use within the Valles Caldera. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 249, at 107-08. Hence, Jemez Pueblo's claim in United States ex rel. Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana & Zia v. Abousleman is not inconsistent with the United States' opposition to that claim here. 400.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo's judicial estoppel argument also does not satisfy the second factor, which requires the court to ask \\u201cwhether the party \\u2018succeeded in persuading a court to accept that party's earlier position, so that judicial acceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create the perception that either the first or the second court was misled,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d BancInsure, Inc. v. F.D.I.C., 796 F.3d at 1239 (quoting New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. at 750, 121 S.Ct. 1808), because Jemez Pueblo does not account for the fact that Magistrate Judge Lynch declines to adopt the United States' legal position. Magistrate Judge Lynch recommends that Judge V\\u00e1zquez \\u201cfind that the Pueblos possessed aboriginal water rights prior to the Spanish occupation of New Mexico, but conclude that the Spanish crown exercised complete dominion and control over New Mexico in a manner adverse to the Pueblos and thus extinguished the Pueblos' aboriginal water rights,\\u201d United States ex rel. Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana & Zia v. Abousleman, No. CV 83-1041 MV/WPL, 2016 WL 9776586, at *1, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS, 191054 at *4, and although Magistrate Judge Lynch states that Spain generally \\u201cappears to have recognized aboriginal title to land,\\u201d he also states: \\u201c[W]hen an Indian tribe ceases for any reason, by reduction of population or otherwise, to actually and exclusively occupy and use an area of land clearly established by clear and adequate proof, such land becomes the exclusive property of the United States as public lands,\\u201d as such, \\u201cthe Indians lose their right to claim and assert full beneficial interest and ownership to such land,\\u201d United States ex rel. Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana & Zia v. Abousleman, No. CV 83-1041 MV/WPL, 2016 WL 9776586, at *2 (quoting Quapaw Tribe v. United States, 120 F. Supp. 283, 286 (Ct. Cl. 1954)). Hence, because Judge V\\u00e1zquez adoped Magistrate Judge Lynch's proposed findings, see United States ex rel. Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Ana & Zia v. Abousleman, No. CV 83-1041 MV/WPL, 2017 WL 4364145, at *4, the Court further concludes that the United States could not stand to benefit unfairly from its arguments in that case regardless whether inconsistent with the arguments that the United States presents here. 401.\\u2003Moreover, any ostensible inconsistency regarding criteria sufficient to prevail on an aboriginal title claim would involve solely legal arguments; however, pursuant to Tenth Circuit precedent, \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018the position to be estopped must generally be one of fact rather than of law or legal theory.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d United States v. Supreme Court of New Mexico, 839 F.3d 888, 912 (10th Cir. 2016) (quoting Johnson v. Lindon City Corp., 405 F.3d at 1069; and citing BancInsure, Inc. v. F.D.I.C., 796 F.3d at 1240 (\\u201cNotably, we have held that judicial estoppel only applies when the position to be estopped is one of fact, not one of law.\\u201d)); United States v. Villagrana-Flores, 467 F.3d at 1279 (\\u201cEven if we were to agree that the government took two clearly conflicting positions, \\u2024 the existence of a Fourth Amendment violation is a legal position, not a factual one, and therefore the first judicial estoppel factor has not been satisfied.\\u201d). The factors requisite to establish, maintain, and extinguish aboriginal title form the basis for legal arguments. Therefore, even if the United States has presented conflicting arguments regarding such factors, pursuant to Tenth Circuit precedent, the judicial-estoppel doctrine is inapposite. V.\\u2003JEMEZ PUEBLO HAS NOT ESTABLISHED THAT IT EVER POSSESSED ABORIGINAL TITLE TO THE VALLES CALDERA. 402.\\u2003To establish aboriginal title, Jemez Pueblo must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018actual, exclusive, and continuous use and occupancy\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d of the Valles Caldera \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018for a long time.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165 (quoting Sac & Fox Tribe of Indians of Okla. v. United States, 383 F.2d at 998). To satisfy its burden to establish exclusive aboriginal use, Jemez Pueblo \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018must show that it used and occupied the land to the exclusion of other Indian groups,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165-66 (emphasis added by the Tenth Circuit in Pueblo of Jemez v. United States)(quoting Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1394), and that it \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018exercised control over [the claimed area] and over other Indians who may have ventured therein,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166 (modification in original)(quoting Caddo Tribe of Okla. v. United States, 35 Ind. Cl. Comm. at 358-60). Dominion and control sufficient to confer land ownership \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018is called in question where the historical record of the region indicates that it was inhabited, controlled or wandered over by many tribes or groups. Ordinarily, where two or more tribes inhabit an area no tribe will satisfy the requirement of showing such \\u2018exclusive\\u2019 use.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 81, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1098 (quoting United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1394). A.\\u2003JEMEZ PUEBLO HAS ACTUALLY AND CONTINUOUSLY USED THE VALLES CALDERA FOR A LONG TIME. 403.\\u2003Evidence presented at trial shows that Jemez Pueblo actually and continuously used the Valles Caldera. Such evidence is sufficient to satisfy the actual land use and occupancy requirements to prove aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera. Moreover, third-party actions have not impacted Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use and occupancy in a manner sufficient to defeat Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera claim. 1. Jemez Pueblo Historically Used the Valles Caldera in a Manner Sufficient to Establish Aboriginal Title. 404.\\u2003Actual use and occupancy necessary to establish aboriginal title is a question of fact, see Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 345, 62 S.Ct. 248 (1941); Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165, which must account for a Tribe's specific \\u201chabits and modes of life,\\u201d Mitchel v. United States, 34 U.S. at 746. See also United States v. Seminole Indians of State of Fla., 180 Ct. Cl. at 384 (\\u201cHad the Seminoles chosen to live by food-raising alone, we would regard the \\u2018village\\u2019 evidence \\u2024 as \\u2024 persuasive \\u2024 in limiting the Seminoles' \\u2018title\\u2019 to the land falling within \\u2024 their permanent homesites, \\u2024 [b]ut the Seminoles \\u2024 survived \\u2024 by food-gathering and hunting as well\\u2024 Seminole land-use \\u2024 encompassed more than the soil actually \\u2018possessed.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d). Moreover, such traditional habits and modes also include intermittent or seasonal land use. See United States v. Seminole Indians of State of Fla., 180 Ct. Cl. at 385-86 (\\u201c[T]he \\u2018use and occupancy\\u2019 \\u2024 essential to the recognition of Indian title does not demand actual possession of the land, but may derive through intermittent contacts \\u2024 which define some general boundaries of the occupied land.\\u201d) (quoting Spokane Tribe v. United States, 163 Ct. Cl. at 66); Native Village of Eyak, 688 F.3d at 623 (\\u201c[I]ntermittent or seasonal use is sufficient to support aboriginal title because it's consistent with the seasonal nature of the ancestors' way of life as hunters and fisherman.\\u201d); Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon v. United States, 177 Ct. Cl. at 194 (\\u201c\\u2009\\u2018Continuous\\u2019 use does not limit recovery to areas where the tribe had permanent villages, but also includes seasonal or hunting areas over which the Indians had control even though those areas were used only intermittently.\\u201d (quoting Spokane Tribe v. United States, 163 Ct. Cl. at 66)). 405.\\u2003The Tenth Circuit held in this case that, to satisfy the \\u201cactual and continuous use\\u201d requirement, Jemez Pueblo must show that \\u201cthe Jemez people have continued for hundreds of years to use the Valles Caldera for traditional purposes, including hunting, grazing of livestock, gathering of medicine and of food for subsistence and the like,\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166, but this requirement does not demand that Jemez Pueblo use every square foot of land within its aboriginal territory, provided such unused land is \\u201cbarren, inaccessible, or useless,\\u201d Tlingit and Haida Indians, 147 Ct. Cl. at 328, 177 F.Supp. 452 (\\u201c[W]here the Indians have proved that they used and occupied a definable area of land, the barren, inaccessible or useless areas encompassed within such an overall tract \\u2024 have not been eliminated from the area of total ownership.\\u201d). For example, in Zuni Tribe of New Mexico v. United States, the Claims Court emphasizes the claim area's \\u201chighly varied physical environment,\\u201d which \\u201crequires an extensive and flexible land use system so that if a particular resource is not available at one place when it is needed it can be obtained elsewhere.\\u201d 12 Cl. Ct. at 611. The Claims Court states that, given the variations in precipitation and climate, the Zuni required \\u201ca relatively large \\u2018sustaining area,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d and that agriculture and livestock use \\u201cwould likewise vary.\\u201d Zuni Tribe v. United States, 12 Cl. Ct. at 612, 615-16. Such variations created \\u201ca rich diversity of wild plants and animals found within the claim area\\u201d that \\u201cprovided the Zunis with adequate food and materials to sustain life.\\u201d 12 Cl. Ct. at 612-13. Hence, the Claims Court concludes, \\u201c[t]he entire claim area was used by the Zuni for one purpose or another including: habitation \\u2024 and \\u2024 farming, hunting, grazing, gathering, and religious worship.\\u201d 12 Cl. Ct. at 641. 406.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo showed at trial that it actually and continuously used and occupied the Valles Caldera for a long time in its traditional Indian ways. Ancestral Jemez Pueblo members migrated to the Jemez Mountains in the 1200s and, between 1300 and 1700 C.E., built within the northern Rio Jemez watershed thirty-five villages and thousands of fieldhouses -- primarily for agricultural purposes -- approximately 100 of which were on the Banco Bonito in the Valles Caldera's southwest quadrant. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 52, 64, 66, at 25, 36. Ancestral Jemez people typically occupied their fieldhouses for at least ninety days during growing seasons, although they also used these fieldhouses to hunt game, to gather medicinal plants, to move about the landscape, and to demarcate territory. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 67-68, at 36-37. Moreover, Jemez peoples left distinctive Jemez Black-on-white pottery throughout the Valles Caldera, and harvested obsidian from the Valles Caldera's Cerro del Medio quarry. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 82, 99, 107-109, at 47, 53, 57-58. The Court therefore concludes that Jemez Pueblo showed at trial actual and continuous Valles Caldera use for a long time. 2. Spanish Constraints on Jemez Pueblo Did Not Disturb Jemez Pueblo's Actual and Continuous Valles Caldera Use Sufficient to Preclude Jemez Pueblo's Aboriginal Title Claim. 407.\\u2003Mere Spanish sovereignty over the Valles Caldera is insufficient to affect Jemez Pueblo's actual and continuous Valles Caldera use to preclude its aboriginal title claim, because \\u201c[t]he Spanish \\u2024 government[\\u2009] recognized the Pueblos' land titles.\\u201d New Mexico v. Aamodt, 537 F.2d at 1108. See Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 347, 62 S.Ct. 248 (\\u201cNor is it true, \\u2024 that a tribal claim to any particular lands must be based upon a treaty, statute, or other formal government action.\\u201d); Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1158 n.11 (\\u201c[A] tribe's aboriginal title does not require an affirmative act of the sovereign for its continued viability.\\u201d) For example, the Claims Court has concluded that, regarding Zuni Pueblo, \\u201cthe Spanish \\u2024 recognized the Zunis' right to, and permitted the Zunis to, continue such use and occupancy of lands as they had been accustomed to prior to the assumption of \\u2024 Spanish[\\u2009] jurisdiction (i.e., to the lands the Zuni had used since time immemorial).\\u201d Zuni Tribe of New Mexico v. United States, 12 Cl. Ct. at 653 n.14. Moreover, historic Spanish land grants to Tribes do not per se preclude aboriginal title claims to lands beyond such grants. See Zia et al. v. United States, 11 Ind. Cl. Comm. at 164 (\\u201cWe believe that the [Mohave Tribe of Indians v. United States, 7 Ind. Cl. Comm. 219], and Santa Fe decisions give petitioners the same rights to aboriginal title as those given to other Indian tribes in this area in spite of their having received valid Spanish grants.\\u201d); Zia II, 165 Ct. Cl. at 507 (noting without disagreement the ICC's assertion in Zia et al. v. United States regarding aboriginal title claims to lands beyond Spanish grants). 408.\\u2003Moreover, given the paucity of specific evidence regarding traditional aboriginal activities in the Jemez Mountains during the Spanish colonial period, the Court credits the conclusions that historians draw to infer that such use occurred based on specific use evidence from the pre-Spanish period. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 79, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1096-97 (\\u201c[F]actual support for an aboriginal title claim may include: \\u2024 expert testimony of historians in the field of American history.\\u201d (citing Otoe & Missouria Tribe v. United States, 131 F. Supp. at 289-91)); supra FOFs \\u00b6 137 n.71, at 71-72 (\\u201cA historian, however, can make an educated inference that Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use continued based on past uses and present uses.\\u201d). 409.\\u2003The trial establishes that, although the Spanish forcibly removed virtually all Jemez Pueblo members to Walatowa beginning in 1598 C.E., Jemez Pueblo nevertheless resisted Spanish removal efforts, and returned several times to their ancestral Jemez Mountains villages before and after the Pueblo Revolt. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 142-44, 145, at 74-75. Such resistance periods included maintaining all traditional Indian activities throughout Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal territory, including the Valles Caldera, at least until Spanish military forces decisively defeated Jemez Pueblo in 1696 C.E. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 152, 153 n.83, at 78-79. Spain thereafter granted Jemez Pueblo 17,500 acres extending from Walatowa's center and designated the Valles Caldera as public domain land, and although the Court disagrees with Jemez Pueblo that through this designation Spain recognized that the Pueblos could continue to use the lands they had traditionally used before the Spanish arrived or that Jemez Pueblo had any property interest in the Valles Caldera, the Court concludes that the public-lands designation facilitated Jemez Pueblo's ability to continue to use the Valles Caldera for traditional activities such as grazing livestock and collecting herbs. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 144 n.76, 146-50, at 77. Moreover, Spain encouraged Jemez Pueblo's traditional agricultural and artisanal activities given that such activities ensured Jemez Pueblo's ability to pay tribute to Spain. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 144 n.76, at 75. Spain did not recognize, however, Jemez Pueblo's religion, and the Spanish repressed Jemez Pueblo's religious exercise, including pilgrimages to Redondo Peak. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 144 n.76, 146 n.77, 150 n.79, 152 n.81, 154 n.84, at 75-80. 410.\\u2003The United States argues that the trial establishes that, by the 1600s, disease and warfare with the Spanish decimated Jemez Pueblo's population, which enabled the Spanish to forcibly remove Jemez Pueblo to Walatowa, and that, by 1744 C.E., Jemez Pueblo's population had plummeted to as low as 100 individuals living twenty miles from Redondo Peak, thereby, effectively foreclosing Jemez Pueblo's ability to use the Valles Caldera, according to the United States. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 150 n.79, at 77, COLs \\u00b6 200, at 353. The Court concludes, however, that, despite these significant restrictions and constraints, which resulted in a sizable decrease in Jemez Pueblo's population, Jemez Pueblo nevertheless did not cease its actual and continuous Valles Caldera use during the Spanish colonial period. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 156-61, at 81-83. 3. Mexican Sovereignty Had No Effect on Jemez Pueblo's Actual and Continuous Valles Caldera Use. 411.\\u2003In 1821, the Mexican revolutionary government adopted the Plan of Iguala, which declared that \\u201c[a]ll inhabitants of New Spain, without any distinction between Europeans, Africans, or Indians, are citizens of this Monarchy \\u2024 and that the person and property of every citizen will be respected and protected by the government.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1153. Shortly thereafter, Mexico assumed sovereignty over the Valles Caldera through the Treaty of Cordova. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1153 (\\u201cThe Treaty of Cordova between Spain and Mexico, ratified on August 24, 1821, \\u2024 established Mexican Independence.\\u201d). The Treaty of Cordova adopted the principles that the Plan of Iguala sets forth and, thus, respected and protected the Pueblos' real property interests. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1153 (\\u201cThe Treaty of Cordova between Spain and Mexico, ratified on August 24, 1821, adopted the principles set forth in the Plan of Iguala and established Mexican Independence.\\u201d); United States v. Ritchie, 58 U.S. 17 How. 525, 538, 15 L.Ed. 236 (1854)(quoting Plan of Iguala); New Mexico v. Aamodt, 537 F.2d at 1108 (\\u201cMexican governments recognized the Pueblos' land titles.\\u201d). 412.\\u2003The land grants that Mexico issued to non-Indians are subject to the Pueblos' right of occupancy. See Johnson v. M'Intosh, 21 U.S. at 574 (asserting that sovereign-nation land grants to non-Indians \\u201chave been understood by all, to convey a title to the grantees, subject only to the Indian right of occupancy\\u201d). Moreover, the laws protecting the Pueblos' property rights remained substantially the same as during the Spanish and Mexican regimes, and permitted the Pueblos to use and occupy their aboriginal lands as they had been accustomed to before Mexico came into existence; for example, the Claims Court has concluded that \\u201cthe Mexicans, as the Spanish before them, recognized the Zunis' right to, and permitted the Zunis to, continue such use and occupancy of lands as they had been accustomed to prior to the assumption of Mexican \\u2024 jurisdiction (i.e., to the lands the Zuni had used since time immemorial).\\u201d Zuni Tribe of New Mexico v. United States, 12 Cl. Ct. at 653 n.14. 413.\\u2003At the trial, neither party presented evidence that Mexico legislated regarding, or otherwise affected, the Valles Caldera. The record indicates that the Mexican government was virtually absent from the Jemez Mountains during the Mexican period, which spanned from 1821 to 1848, and is otherwise silent regarding Jemez Pueblo's actual and continuous Valles Caldera use after Mexico assumed sovereignty over those lands. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 170 n.95, at 86. Hence, absent specific evidence to the contrary, the Court concludes that Jemez Pueblo continued to actually and continuously use the Valles Caldera during the Mexico period. 4. Jemez Pueblo Actually and Continuously Used the Valles Caldera After the United States Acquired Sovereignty Over Those Lands. 414.\\u2003The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo transferred sovereignty over the Valles Caldera from Mexico to the United States. See Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, 9 Stat. 922. \\u201cIn the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the United States agreed to protect rights recognized by prior sovereigns,\\u201d New Mexico v. Aamodt, 537 F.2d at 1108-09, and guaranteed that it would honor the aboriginal Indian title to the Pueblos' land throughout the area that Mexico ceded to the United States, see Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1156 (citing Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, 9 Stat. 922, 928)(\\u201cIn Article VIII of the Treaty, the United States agreed to respect pre-existing property rights of all Mexican citizens, which included the Indians living within the territory covered by the Treaty.\\u201d). Read together with the Plan of Iguala and the Treaty of Cordova, \\u201cArticle VIII of the Treaty between Mexico and the United States effectively recognized the then-existing property rights of the pueblo Indians.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1156. Moreover, the United States in this case concedes that, in Article VIII of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, the United States agrees to respect all Mexican citizens' pre-existing property rights, which includes the Indians living within the territory that the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo covers. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1156 (\\u201cThe government concedes this much in its brief on appeal.\\u201d) (citing Response Brief for the United States at 7-8, filed July 17, 2014 (Doc. 01019280803 on the Tenth Circuit's docket)). 415.\\u2003Unlike the Mexican government, the United States maintained an active presence in the Jemez Mountains following New Mexico's acquisition from Mexico in 1848. See FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 171-72, 175, 177-83, 185-86, 188, at 86-91. For example, in 1851, United States Army contractors established a hay camp within the Valles Caldera and thereafter defended the camp against Navajo attacks. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 171-74, at 86-87. In 1856, New Mexico militiamen tracked Navajo raiders into the Valle Grande. See supra FOF \\u00b6 175, at 87. Moreover, in August, 1863, the United States Army established a forty-man military outpost on the Valle Grande and continuously operated the Valle Grande outpost until May, 1864. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 177-80, at 87-88. 416.\\u2003The Court declines to adopt the United States' reliance on Uintah Ute Indians of Utah v. United States, 28 Fed. Cl. at 787-88, for the assertion that that, in constructing and manning the Valles Grande outpost, which the United States refers to as a \\u201cfort,\\u201d the United States extinguished aboriginal rights to the Valles Caldera. United States' Br. at 73 (citing Uintah Ute Indians of Utah v. United States, 28 Fed. Cl. at 787-88 (\\u201cEven if Indians continued to occupy some portion of the Fort's land, \\u2024 a military base destroys the exclusivity prong of the aboriginal title test\\u2024 That the government established a military outpost is even more inconsistent with Indian title than occupation by white settlers.\\u201d)). To begin, the United States does not argue how the outpost satisfies the criteria that the Court identifies in the Court's extinguishment analysis. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 118-19, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1119. Moreover, the United States does not account fully for the fact that the Tribe in Uintah Ute Indians of Utah v. United States, \\u201cin effect, concede[d] that it had not actually, exclusively, and continuously occupied the subject land up to 1991, the alleged taking date.\\u201d 28 Fed. Cl. at 787. Rather than concluding that a temporary military encampment extinguishes aboriginal Indian title, the Court of Federal Claims in Uintah Ute Indians of Utah v. United States determined, based on undisputed facts, that the Tribe left the claim area after the United States Army built, officially inaugurated, and expanded multiple times over several decades a permanent military fort that remained in operation until 1991. See Uintah Ute Indians of Utah v. United States, 28 Fed. Cl. at 787. Hence, the question in Uintah Ute Indians of Utah v. United States was abandonment and not extinguishment. Here, the Valles Grande outpost was in operation only for ten months, most of which occurred during the winter season. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 177-80, at 87-88. The United States Army built the outpost to support its campaign against the Navajos, and the Army neither officially inaugurated nor expanded it. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 177-80, at 87-88. Significantly, the Army abandoned the outpost in 1863, see supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 180, at 88, and, unlike the evidence in Uintah Ute Indians of Utah v. United States, the record here contains no evidence of \\u201cIndian departure from the lands encompassed\\u201d by the outpost, Uintah Ute Indians of Utah v. United States, 28 Fed. Cl. at 768. Therefore, the Valles Grande outpost does not factor into the Court's analysis whether Congress intended to extinguish aboriginal rights to the Valles Caldera. 417.\\u2003The record from this period also evidences that Jemez Pueblo members actively used the Valles Caldera to graze and defend livestock, to launch attacks against Navajo Nation members, and to traverse the Valles Grande unimpeded while en route to other destinations within the Jemez Mountains. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 174, 176-77, 180, 188, at 87-91. The Court concludes that such evidence is sufficient to prove that Jemez Pueblo actually and continuously used the Valles Caldera after the United States acquired New Mexico from Mexico. 5. The Grant to the Baca Heirs Does Not Preclude Jemez Pueblo's Aboriginal Title Claim. 418.\\u2003Congress in 1854 established the office of Surveyor General for New Mexico and ordered the Surveyor General \\u201cto ascertain the origin, nature, character, and extent of all claims to lands under the laws, usages, and customs of Spain and Mexico,\\u201d and to report on the validity of claims that \\u201coriginated before the cession of the territory to the United States \\u2024 denoting the various grades of title, with his decision as to the validity or invalidity of each of the same under the laws, usages, and customs of the country before its cession to the United States.\\u201d Act of July 22, 1854, 10 Stat. 308 (\\u201c1854 Act\\u201d); Pueblo of Jemez v.

Congress also ordered a report \\u201cin regard to all pueblos existing in the Territory, showing the extent and locality of each, stating the number of inhabitants in the said pueblos, respectively, and the nature of their titles to the land.\\u201d 10 Stat. at 308; Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1156 (quoting the 1854 Act). The report \\u201cshall be laid before Congress for such action thereon as may be deemed just and proper, with a view to confirm bona fide grants, and give full effect to the treaty.\\u201d 10 Stat. at 308; Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1156 (quoting the 1854 Act). 419.\\u2003Based on the Surveyor General's report, Congress in 1860 passed an act to settle a Mexican land-grant dispute between the town of Las Vegas, New Mexico, and the heirs of Luis Maria Cabeza de Baca by allowing the town to retain title over the contested land and authorizing the Baca heirs \\u201cto select instead of the land claimed by them, an equal quantity of vacant land, not mineral, in the Territory of New Mexico, to be located by them in square bodies, not exceeding five in number.\\u201d Act of June 21, 1860, 12 Stat. 71, 72 (\\u201c1860 Act\\u201d); Shaw v. Kellogg, 170 U.S. 312, 314, 18 S.Ct. 632, 42 L.Ed. 1050 (1898)(quoting the 1860 Act). Hence, the 1860 Act required the Surveyor General to authorize transfer if the lands were vacant and non-mineral, and to forbid transfer if the lands did not meet the statutory requirements. See Shaw v. Kellogg, 170 U.S. at 330, 338, 18 S.Ct. 632. The Baca heirs selected land that encompasses the Valles Caldera, and the Surveyor General accordingly approved their selection based on his belief that the land was vacant. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1157. Through the 1860 Act, Congress also confirmed, on the Surveyor General's recommendation, several other private land claims arising under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1157. 420.\\u2003The United States argues that the \\u201cUnited States' grant to the Baca heirs conveyed \\u2018full, absolute, and unconditional title\\u2019 that was \\u2018not subject to challenge,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d United States' Br. at 71 (quoting Shaw v. Kellogg, 170 U.S. at 343, 18 S.Ct. 632), because, according to the United States, \\u201cCongress did \\u2018not contemplate[\\u2009] that the title [to the Baca locations] should remain unsettled,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d United States' Br. at 71 (quoting Shaw v. Kellogg, 170 U.S. at 331, 18 S.Ct. 632 (alterations in United States' Br.)); however, as the Tenth Circuit notes in this case, \\u201cthe [1860] Act declared in section 4 \\u2018[t]hat the foregoing confirmation shall only be construed as quit-claims or relinquishments, on the part of the United States, and shall not affect the adverse rights of any other person or persons whomsoever,\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1157 (quoting the 1860 Act (emphasis in Pueblo of Jemez v. United States)). Accordingly, the Court declines to adopt the United States' argument that the 1860 Act and grant to the Baca heirs extinguished as a matter of law Jemez Pueblo's alleged aboriginal title. See Pueblo of Jemez, 790 F.3d at 1164-65 (\\u201c[T]he Baca heirs were granted fee title subject to any pre-existing aboriginal occupancy rights of the Jemez Pueblo.\\u201d). Moreover, the Court notes that, as a matter of law, there is no language in the 1860 Act that purports to extinguish aboriginal title. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1170 (\\u201c[A]boriginal title cannot be extinguished by the grant to a third party of fee title to the land at issue except by clear and unambiguous congressional intent.\\u201d). Congress did not link the 1860 Act or subsequent Baca grant to a specific or broader attempt to open Indian lands to non-Indian settlement, but merely acted to settle conflicting land claims between Las Vegas, New Mexico inhabitants and Baca's successors in interest. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 6-7, 350 F.Supp.3d at 1059-60 (\\u201cCongress settled this conflict by allowing the inhabitants of Las Vegas to retain title over the contested land and passing a statute authorizing the Baca heirs \\u2018to select \\u2024 vacant land, not mineral, in the Territory of New Mexico.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d (quoting 1860 Act)). 421.\\u2003The Court further concludes that the Surveyor General's conclusion that the Valles Caldera lands were vacant before the 1860 Act is of no import, as the Surveyor General lacked authority to extinguish aboriginal Indian title. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1163 (\\u201c[T]he conclusion of the Surveyor General of New Mexico that the lands at issue were vacant and thus could be transferred to the Baca heirs did not by itself serve to extinguish existing aboriginal title.\\u201d); id. at 1164 (\\u201cIt therefore makes no difference that the Surveyor General believed the land selected by the Baca heirs was vacant. He had no authority to extinguish the Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title.\\u201d); Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 42, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1077-78 (\\u201c[B]ecause the Surveyor-General had no authority to extinguish aboriginal title, his belief as to vacancy of the lands is irrelevant\\u201d). Absent a demonstrable congressional intent to extinguish pre-existing aboriginal rights to the Valles Caldera, \\u201cthe grant \\u2018asserted a title against Europeans only and was considered as blank paper so far as the rights of natives were concerned.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 77, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1096 (quoting Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. at 546). Having no such congressional intent, the 1860 Act permitting the Baca heirs to acquire the Valles Caldera was insufficient to preclude Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim to those lands. 6. Despite Private Owners' Restrictions, Jemez Pueblo Actually and Continuously Used the Valles Caldera in a Manner Sufficient to Maintain an Aboriginal Title Claim. 422.\\u2003To satisfy aboriginal title's actual-and-continuous use requirement, Jemez Pueblo need not prove that the Baca heirs and their successors did not use the Valles Caldera, see Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1172; Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 46, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1080, or that Jemez Pueblo did not expel the Valles Caldera's non-Indian occupants, because simultaneous land occupancy and use under European title and under aboriginal title can -- and often does -- occur given that Indian occupancy differs significantly from non-Indian occupancy, see Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165; Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 46, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1080. The Tenth Circuit in this case affirmed as much when it stated: [I]t is easy to see how the Surveyor General may have mistakenly believed the lands were vacant even if they were being used by the Jemez for hunting, fishing, and other such activities. Similarly, it is also easy to see how a peaceful and private Indian pueblo might have used portions of this large area of land for its traditional purposes while one agreeable rancher was using portions of it for grazing livestock. Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165. Therefore, non-Indian use and occupancy evidence does per se preclude an aboriginal title claim. 423.\\u2003The Court declines to adopt the United States' contention that \\u201cinterference by the Preserve land's private owners with Plaintiff's alleged aboriginal uses prior to 2000, standing alone, is sufficient to defeat any claim to aboriginal title.\\u201d United States' Proposed Conclusions \\u00b6\\u00b6 80, at 20. The United States bases this assertion on the Tenth Circuit's conclusion that \\u201cif there was actually substantial interference by others with these traditional uses \\u2024 Jemez Pueblo will not be able to establish aboriginal title.\\u201d United States' Br. at 74 (quoting Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166). This statement does not, however, stand for the United States' proposition that \\u201c[t]he Tenth Circuit, relying in part on precedents of the Court of Claims, held that federal conveyance of land to private parties, and encroachment on traditional Tribal use, can evidence extinguishment of aboriginal title,\\u201d United States' Br. at 75 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166-67), in part, because the Court must consider the Tenth Circuit's comment alongside controlling Supreme Court precedent, and the Supreme Court has held that congressional intent to extinguish aboriginal title must be \\u201cplain and unambiguous,\\u201d Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 346, 62 S.Ct. 248. Hence, the Court concludes that, to defeat Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim, the \\u201cinterference\\u201d to which the Tenth Circuit refers must be sufficiently \\u201csubstantial\\u201d to compel Jemez Pueblo to cease altogether its Valles Caldera use for traditional, aboriginal purposes. Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166. The Court therefore considers any such interference not in a vacuum but rather for the effect that the interference had on Jemez Pueblo's ability to conduct its traditional activities within the Valles Caldera, specifically whether the interference compelled Jemez Pueblo not to use the Valles Caldera during the private ownership period. 424.\\u2003As further evidence for its position that substantial interference, standing alone, is sufficient to preclude Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim, the United States asserts that the Tenth Circuit cites to the Court of Claims' decision in United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso \\u201cas illustrating how interference defeats a claim of actual and continuous use.\\u201d United States' Br. at 74 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166(\\u201cThe Court of Claims' decision in Pueblo of San Ildefonso, \\u2024 is illustrative of a situation in which white settlement and use, authorized by the federal government both statutorily and in fact, brought about a pre-1946 claim against the United States for failure to protect aboriginal title of the pueblos.\\u201d)). The United States, however, does not account fully for the fact that the Tenth Circuit also cites the Court of Claims' conclusion that authorized white settlement and use \\u201cis only one of various factors to be considered in determining when specific lands were taken,\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1167 (quoting United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1390)(emphasis added), and that the Court of Claims' takings analysis also accounts for Congress creating for the Pueblos a reservation on their historic lands, counting other Tribal lands in a national forest reserve, and granting the Pueblos' remaining lands to non-Indian settlers under the public land laws, see United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1383. Significantly, the Court of Claims concluded that, standing alone, the reservation's creation was insufficient to extinguish aboriginal title to lands not included in the reservations' borders. See 513 F.2d at 1388. The taking occurred only when federal land laws granted non-Indians the right to settle particular lands. See 513 F.2d at 1391. The Court of Claims rejected the argument that non-Indian encroachment could result in the loss of aboriginal title when the affected Tribe did not voluntarily abandon the land in question, see 513 F.2d at 1390, and affirmed that the actions of private individuals cannot affect aboriginal title, see 513 F.2d at 1387 (\\u201c[T]ermination of Indian title is exclusively the province of the United States.\\u201d). The Court of Claims held that there must be \\u201cclear and convincing evidence of an intent to extinguish\\u201d aboriginal title, and that \\u201cthe fact that some entries [by non-Indians] were allowed in the plaintiffs' aboriginal areas is evidence of official negligence, or lack of knowledge of the plaintiffs' areas, rather than an intent on the part of the United States to abolish their whole titles.\\u201d 513 F.2d at 1390. Hence, the Court of Claims in United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso identifies three factors that can lead to the United States gradually taking aboriginal title by implication based on Congressional action that: (i) creates an Indian reservation, (ii) authorizes non-Indian settlement on Tribal lands, and (iii) designates Tribal lands as part of a national forest reserve. See 513 F.2d at 1386. Although these factors inform the Court's extinguishment analysis, such factors do not speak to whether the Valles Caldera's private owners affected Jemez Pueblo's ability to actually and continuously use the Valles Caldera. 425.\\u2003The United States also does not give weight to the fact that the Pueblos before the Court of Claims in United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso conceded that they no longer use their historic lands because of substantial, non-Indian interference, i.e., the question whether the Pueblos actually and continuously used the claim area was not before the Court of Claims. See United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1385 (\\u201cThe three Indian pueblos of San Ildefonso, Santo Domingo and Santa Clara filed claims with the Indian Claims Commission to recover compensation for the extinguishment of aboriginal title to their lands in northern New Mexico.\\u201d). Under the Court's analysis as described above, the three Pueblos in United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso could have maintained their aboriginal title -- at least insofar as the actual use and occupancy requirement is concerned -- despite non-Indian occupancy and use, provided that the Pueblos did not concede the takings question and continued to actually use their historic lands, which is the factual scenario that Jemez Pueblo alleges here. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166 (\\u201cTo show \\u2018actual\\u2019 and \\u2018continuous use,\\u2019 \\u2024 Jemez Pueblo must show, as it alleges in its Complaint, that the Jemez people have continued for hundreds of years to use the Valles Caldera for traditional purposes, including hunting, grazing of livestock, gathering of medicine and of food for subsistence, and the like.\\u201d). 426.\\u2003The trial establishes that the Valles Caldera's private owners significantly affected Jemez Pueblo's access to the Valles Caldera in the twentieth century. For example, upon acquiring the Valles Caldera in 1918, F. Bond insisted that Jemez Pueblo pay standard fees if Jemez Pueblo wanted to graze its livestock within the Valles Caldera and to first obtain his permission before entering those lands, which physically, spiritually, and psychology harmed Jemez Pueblo. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 207, 211-12, 215, at 95-98. In the 1920s, F. Bond altogether prohibited Jemez Pueblo from grazing cattle in the Valles Caldera. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 217, at 99. Bond restrictions in the 1940s forced Jemez Pueblo to conduct ceremonial retreats outside its traditional Redondo Creek and Valles Grande areas, and, by the 1950s, Bond employees were actively patrolling the Valles Caldera to discourage trespassers. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 222, 224, at 100-01. The Bonds had completely fenced the Valles Caldera's exterior boundaries by 1961, and therefore required their lessees to patrol against trespass and to ensure that the main road gates remained locked. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 226-27, at 101-02. When Dunigan acquired the Valles Caldera in 1963, he maintained and added to the existing fencing, and ordered his employees to control trespass, particularly during hunting season to ensure his commercial elk hunting operation's viability. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 228-31, at 102-03. Dunigan strictly prohibited hunting on Baca Location No. 1 without an official permit, and rumors that Dunigan employees would shoot trespassers led to a reputation among locals that the Valles Caldera was a dangerous place. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 232-33, at 103. 427.\\u2003Moreover, the Valles Caldera's private owners significantly restricted Jemez Pueblo religious society's ability to access the Valles Caldera, which forced several societies, [Redacted] to forego using the Valles Caldera during the twentieth century's latter half. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 254, 255, 256, 257, 259-60, at 110-13. [Redacted] See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 243, 247, at 105-07. 428.\\u2003The trial also establishes, however, that, despite private owners' onerous restrictions, Jemez Pueblo nonetheless actually and continuously used the Valles Caldera for many traditional activities. First, the private owners' constraints were not absolute but frequently conditioned on permission that, once obtained, enabled Jemez Pueblo to engage in traditional activities such as [Redacted]. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 215, 250, 250 n.101, 259, at 98, 108-09, 112. Moreover, the record includes evidence that Jemez Pueblo members repeatedly disregarded these restrictions and accessed the Valles Caldera without permission, for example, to conduct religious pilgrimages, to collect medicinal herbs, to graze cattle, and to hunt game. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 215 n.100, 253, 255, 258, at 98, 110-12. Hence, the Court concludes that Jemez Pueblo actually and continuously used the Valles Caldera during the Valles Caldera's private ownership period. 7. The United States' Valles Caldera Acquisition in 2000, and Subsequent Legislation in 2005 and 2015, Does Not Per Se Foreclose Jemez Pueblo's Aboriginal Title Claim, and Jemez Pueblo Has Actually and Continuously Used the Valles Caldera Since 2000. 429.\\u2003In 2000, pursuant to the Preservation Act, the United States purchased the Dunigan family's property interests in the Valles Caldera. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1149-50 (citing Preservation Act). \\u201c[O]ne of the purposes of the [Preservation] Act was to preserve the cultural and historic value of the land \\u2024 while avoiding interference with \\u2018Native American religious and cultural sites.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1172 (quoting Preservation Act). Furthermore, Congress ensured that \\u201cthe management of the Preserve for all of its purposes is to be done in consultation with Indian tribes and pueblos.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1172 (citing Preservation Act 16 U.S.C. \\u00a7 698v-6(f)(5)). \\u201cMoreover, the warranty deed the government accepted from the Baca successors to create the Preserve specifically excepted from the warrants all prior \\u2018claims of and demands of any Indian nation, tribe, or pueblo.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1172 (quoting Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165 n.19). 430.\\u2003The Preservation Act did not extinguish pre-existing aboriginal rights in the Valles Caldera. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1172 (\\u201c[N]owhere in the Preservation Act did Congress say it intended to extinguish aboriginal title.\\u201d). Congressional intent to extinguish aboriginal Indian title must be \\u201cplain and unambiguous.\\u201d Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 346, 62 S.Ct. 248. No language in the Preservation Act expressly or impliedly removes the warranty exception for Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim. Rather, Congress expressly limits the Valles Caldera's management to protect Indian use and occupancy. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 11, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1062 (\\u201cCongress also recognized that \\u2018certain features on the Baca ranch have historical and religious significance to Native Americans,\\u2019 and Congress explained that those features \\u2018can be preserved and protected through Federal acquisition of the property.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d (quoting Preservation Act)). 431.\\u2003The United States citation to Chippewa Indians of Minnesota. v. United States, 305 U.S. 479, 59 S.Ct. 313, 83 L.Ed. 300 (1939), for the proposition that an aboriginal title claim cannot survive a congressional statute that provides federal land managers with complete control over federal lands is inapposite, because in Chippewa Indians of Minnesota v. United States the Supreme Court concludes that the United States extinguished the Chippewa Indian's aboriginal title through legislation establishing national forests, and because Congress \\u201cclearly express[ed] the intent and purpose to deprive the Tribe completely -- by the Act -- of all its remaining beneficial interest in the property.\\u201d Chippewa Indians of Minn. v. United States, 305 U.S. at 482, 59 S.Ct. 313 (emphasis added). Because Congress in the Preservation Act expressed no such clear intent regarding the Valles Caldera, the Preservation Act does not, as a matter of law, preclude an aboriginal title claim. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1172-73 (\\u201c[W]e are not persuaded the government is entitled to dismissal of the Jemez Pueblo's claim based on its contention that Congress' creation of the Preserve extinguished the Pueblo's aboriginal title as a matter of law.\\u201d). 432.\\u2003The United States cites to an amendment to the Preservation Act in 2005 that permits the United States to acquire outstanding mineral interests in the Valles Caldera. See United States' Br. at 95 (citing Preservation Act, 119 Stat. 2570 (Dec. 20, 2005)). The United States does not argue, however, the mechanism through which the 2005 amendment affects an aboriginal title claim, nor how the 2005 amendment supersedes the Preservation Act's express protections for aboriginal use. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 11, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1062. Accordingly, the Court likewise concludes that the 2005 amendment to the Preservation Act does not affect a Tribe's ability to bring an aboriginal title claim. 433.\\u2003The Tenth Circuit remanded on the specific issue whether the 2015 Act, which transfers the Valles Caldera to the National Park Service, extinguished aboriginal Indian title. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1173 n.21. Notably, the Tenth Circuit framed the issue as whether the 2015 Act \\u201cundisputably extinguished any aboriginal title\\u201d to the Valles Caldera. Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1173 n.21 (emphasis added); Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 47, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1080 (quoting Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1173 n.21). The 2015 Act, although repealing the Preservation Act and directing the National Park Service to manage the Valles Caldera, expressly preserved \\u201cvalid existing rights.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1173 n.21 (quoting 2015 Act \\u00a7 3043(b)(13)(C)(13)) (\\u201cNothing in this section affects valid existing rights.\\u201d). Furthermore, in the 2015 Act, Congress does not treat the Valles Caldera as a general National Park Service unit, but rather includes provisions that expressly protect aboriginal use and occupancy, and requires the Valles Caldera's managers to consult with interested Tribes and Pueblos. See 2015 Act \\u00a7 3043(b)(3)(C)(iii)(III) (requiring consultation with \\u201cIndian tribes and pueblos, including the Pueblos of Jemez, Santa Clara, and San Ildefonso.\\u201d); 2015 Act \\u00a7 3043(b)(10) (prohibiting motorized access and construction of roads and buildings above 9,600 feet in elevation, or 250 feet below fifteen summits, to protect Tribal cultural, religious and archaeological resources); 2015 Act \\u00a7 3043(b)(11) (providing for the protection of Pueblo \\u201cTraditional Cultural and Religious Sites,\\u201d and requiring Valles Caldera managers to provide access to \\u201cmembers of Indian tribes or pueblos for traditional cultural and customary uses\\u201d). Rather than satisfying the Court's standard for plain and unambiguous evidence to extinguish aboriginal title when Congress designates lands for federal use, namely \\u201cunilateral actions [that] placed restrictions on the Pueblos' historic use of their land, that is, [that] prevented the Indians from using the land how they saw fit,\\u201d the 2015 Act restricts the United States' land use, and protects Tribes and Pueblo's ability to use the Valles Caldera according to their cultural traditions. Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1119. The Court therefore concludes that the 2015 Act neither extinguishes aboriginal title nor otherwise precludes an aboriginal title claim. 434.\\u2003The trial establishes that Jemez Pueblo has actually and continuously used the Valles Caldera since 2000. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 431-524, at 205-31. For example, within the Valles Caldera, Jemez Pueblo uses [Redacted] See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 431, 433, 439, 463-65, at 205-06, 208, 213.

Jemez Pueblo members [Redacted] See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 440-41, 482-83, 499-500, 506, 508, 515-16, 524, at 208, 221, 225-27, 229, 231. [Redacted] See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 442-44, 522, at 209, 247. Moreover, [Redacted] See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 462, 465-69, 472, 485-87, 491-94, 496, 501-02, 521, 523-24, at 212-15, 222-26, 230-31. 435.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo works closely with Valles Caldera staff to facilitate its ability to actually and continuously use the Valles Caldera, and both the Valles Caldera Trust and the National Park Service have recognized Jemez Pueblo's continuous Redondo Peak use and have incorporated such use into their respective resource management practices. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 474, at 216. For example, Jemez Pueblo has made at least thirteen requests to access Redondo Peak for pilgrimages and other ceremonial activities, which Valles Caldera staff typically grant, and, when non-Indians request access to Redondo Peak, the National Park Service attempts to determine if the request will conflict with a scheduled Jemez Pueblo activity, and, should conflict exists, Valles Caldera staff requests that the non-Indian either choose another day or forego activity that might disturb Jemez Pueblo's Redondo Peak use. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 475-77, at 217-19. Moreover, on at least one occasion, Valles Caldera staff discussed having a Jemez Pueblo member accompany non-Indian researchers to Redondo Peak's summit. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 476, at 217-18. The Valles Caldera Trust and the National Park Service have consulted with Jemez Pueblo regarding Jemez Pueblo's architectural and archaeological interests in the Banco Bonito, La Jara Creek, and Upper Jaramillo Creek, and, on at least one occasion, conducted a field visit with Jemez Pueblo to inspect proposed sites for a scientific device. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 484, 514, at 221-22, 228-29. Such consultations further evince to the Court Jemez Pueblo's sincere, longstanding relationship with the Valles Caldera. 436.\\u2003The Court notes that Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use dramatically increased after the United States' purchase in 2000. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 477 n.157, at 218-20. The United States argues such an increase is not probative whether Jemez Pueblo possessed aboriginal title before 2000, because it represents merely an attempt to manufacture evidence to support Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim, and, therefore, deserves little, if any, weight. See United States' Br. at 80 (citing Coletti v. Cudd Pressure Control, 165 F.3d at 775 (advising that, similar to the adverse inference attendant to evidence spoliation, one can draw an adverse inference from the \\u201cfraudulent creation of evidence\\u201d)). Although the Court agrees with the United States that Jemez Pueblo has adopted policies aimed, in part, at increasing and documenting its Valles Caldera use to support its aboriginal title claim, such behavior is nonetheless based on a sincerely held belief in and connection to the Valles Caldera as Jemez Pueblo's traditional aboriginal homeland for many centuries. The resolutions that Jemez Pueblo obtained from other American Indian entities further evidence Jemez Pueblo's enduring relationship to these lands. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 535-66, at 238-252. Moreover, given that Jemez Pueblo has for at least the past twenty years petitioned the United States for the right to acquire the Valles Caldera, see supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 324-26, 328, at 142-145, the Court is neither surprised that Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use increased once the United States made those lands accessible to Pueblos and Tribes, nor that Jemez Pueblo thoroughly documented such use while considering whether to pursue a QTA action. Hence, although the Court agrees with the United States' assertion that Jemez Pueblo cannot establish aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera based on use that occurred after 2000, such use is relevant support for the Court's conclusion that Jemez Pueblo actually and continuously used the Valles Caldera through the alleged interference date. B.\\u2003JEMEZ PUEBLO'S VALLES CALDERA USE WAS NOT EXCLUSIVE. 437.\\u2003Evidence presented at trial disproves Jemez Pueblo's claim that it was the Valles Caldera's exclusive aboriginal user. Moreover, Jemez Pueblo's non-exclusive Valles Caldera use does not fit within a recognized exception to aboriginal title's exclusive-use requirement. Jemez Pueblo, therefore, cannot satisfy the burden of proof necessary to establish aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera. 1. Many Pueblos and Tribes Historically Used and Continue to Use the Valles Caldera. 438.\\u2003In addition to showing actual and continuous use for a long time, Jemez Pueblo must also prove that it had \\u201cexclusive\\u201d use and occupancy of the Valles Caldera. Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 74, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1094 (citing Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 345, 62 S.Ct. 248) (\\u201cIf \\u2024 the lands in question \\u2024 were included in[\\u2009] the ancestral home of the Walapais in the sense that they constituted definable territory occupied exclusively by the Walapais (as distinguished from lands wandered over by many tribes), then the Walapais had \\u2018Indian title.\\u2019\\u2009\\u201d (quoting Buttz v. N. Pac. R.R. Co., 119 U.S. at 66, 7 S.Ct. 100)). To carry this burden, the Tribe must show that it \\u201cused and occupied the land to the exclusion of other Indian Groups.\\u201d Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1165-66 (quoting United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1394). The Tenth Circuits' full comments and corresponding support are particularly insightful: The government contends the Jemez Pueblo cannot prove \\u201cexclusive\\u201d use because the Baca heirs used the land. But the \\u201cexclusive\\u201d part of the test meant only that in order to establish aboriginal title, a tribe \\u201cmust show that it used and occupied the land to the exclusion of other Indian groups.\\u201d Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1394 (emphasis added); see also Native Village of Eyak, 688 F.3d at 624 (\\u201cExclusivity is established when a tribe or a group shows that it used and occupied the land to the exclusion of other Indian groups.\\u201d); Zuni Tribe of N.M. v.

United States, 790 F.3d at 1165-66. The caselaw therefore makes clear that Jemez Pueblo must have exercised dominion and control sufficient to expel intruders. See Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 345, 62 S.Ct. 248; Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166. In United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, the Court of Claims further describes this requirement: Implicit in the concept of ownership of property is the right to exclude others. Generally speaking, a true owner of land exercises full dominion and control over it; a true owner possesses the right to expel intruders True ownership of land by a tribe is called in question where the historical record of the region indicates that it was inhabited, controlled or wandered over by many tribes or groups. Ordinarily, where two or more tribes inhabit an area no tribe will satisfy the requirement of showing such \\u201cexclusive\\u201d use. United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1394. See Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 561 (\\u201cOne of the primary characteristics of ownership is the desire and ability to exclude others from the area over which ownership is claimed.\\u201d). 439.\\u2003The ability to exercise dominion and control considers a Tribe's power to expel outsiders, and, \\u201cwhere there is no evidence that the tribes exercised full dominion and control of the claimed area,\\u201d such power is a function of population.

United States, 19 Ind. Cl. Comm. 481, 490 (1968)(concluding that the Osage Nation lacked exclusive control given their low population and evidence suggesting that other parties used the land).

United States, 696 F.2d 1378, 1385 (Fed. Cir. 1983). In Wichita Indian Tribe v. United States, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected the United States' argument that other Indian tribes interfered with the Wichita Indian Tribe's exclusive use and occupancy of a claim area in Texas, because \\u201cthe evidence supporting mutual use of this land [was] not specific enough to justify a finding of a lack of exclusive use of all the Texas lands, especially given the Wichitas' role as traders and their friendly relationship with these tribes.\\u201d Wichita Indian Tribe v. United States, 696 F.2d at 1385. See Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas v. United States, No. 3-83, 2000 WL 1013532, at *17 (concluding that a hearing officer's finding -- that other Tribes' presence in the claim area precluded the claimant Tribe's ability to establish exclusive use -- was clearly erroneous, because the record contained \\u201cno probative evidence\\u201d that the other Tribes \\u201coccupied or used\\u201d the claim area); Spokane Tribe of Indians v. United States, 163 Ct. Cl. at 64 n.5 (\\u201c[S]cattered observations that other Indians were at one or another time found at one or another spot [inside the claim area] cannot be given any substantial weight. These casual observations do not indicate whether the alien Indians were there as visitors, on a temporary basis, etc.\\u201d). 441.\\u2003Archeological evidence presented at the trial establishes that, for many hundreds of years, ancestors of the modern Keres and Tewa Pueblos, which includes the modern Pueblos of Acoma, Chochiti, Laguna, Nambe, Ohkay Owingeh, Pojoaque, San Felipe, San Ildefonso, Santa Ana, Santa Clara, Santo Domingo, Tesuque, and Zia, densely occupied the Jemez Mountains' eastern slopes, including the major drainages that served as paths into the Valles Caldera. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 52-58, 61, 71, at 25-33, 39. Since the 1200s, large populations of ancestral Keres, Tewa, and Navajo Nation members in the area surrounding the Valles Caldera used their trails to access the Valles Caldera in a manner virtually indistinguishable from Jemez Pueblo, that is, to hunt, to gather plants, to collect obsidian, and to conduct other traditional practices. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 56, 58, 60, 72, 73, 74, 110, 111, 112, at 28-30, 32-33, 39-43, 58-59. Significantly, Santa Clara Pueblo has for centuries lived next to the Valles Caldera, and two large, ancestral Santa Clara Pueblo villages totaling approximately 3,200 rooms are located in Santa Clara canyon, a few miles from the Valles Caldera's northeast border. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 62, at 35. 442.\\u2003The trial establishes that ancestral Keres and Tewa peoples would bring pottery with them on at least some trips to the Valles Caldera, and broken pottery fragments found throughout those lands prove that ancestral Keres and Tewa members actually and continuous used the Valles Caldera from at least 1250 C.E. through at least 1750 C.E. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 75, 76, 77, 79-81, 83-84, 85, 87, 88, at 43-49. Sites that archeologists affiliate with ancestral Tewa and Keres populations -- including the Valles Caldera's most robust ceramics evidence, which archeologists excavated at [Redacted] -- are the most common sites in the Valles Caldera's southeast and south central areas, i.e., the areas closest to ancestral Keres and Tewa villages. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 89, at 49. The ceramics record also demonstrates that ancestral Tewa and Keres peoples used the Valles Caldera's northern portions. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 91, at 50. The pre-Pueblo Revolt Tewa and Keres ceramics found at [Redacted] are especially probative of Tewa and Keres' Valles Caldera use, because Tewa and Jemez peoples did not trade pottery, or any goods, before the Pueblo Revolt, and trade between ancestral Jemez and other Tribes was so infrequent before the Pueblo Revolt that it accounted for less than three percent of pottery found at Jemez Pueblo sites. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 89, 90, at 49-50. Accordingly, although many groups, including ancestral Jemez Pueblo, may have used [Redacted], the Court concludes that the site is predominantly Tewa. Even within the Banco Bonito, where Jemez Pueblo pottery dominates, archeologists have discovered Tewa pottery in substantial quantities, and the record also contains evidence that multiple Zia Pueblo religious societies would traverse the Banco Bonito while pilgrimaging to numerous locations throughout the Valles Caldera, including Redondo Peak and [Redacted]. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 69, 73, 86, at 38-40, 48. The Court concludes that, because the predominant ceramics evidence found throughout the Valles Caldera has an ancestral Tewa and Keres affiliation, Tribes other than Jemez Pueblo actually and continuously used those lands for a long time. 443.\\u2003The trial similarly establishes that many Pueblos and Tribes used the Valles Caldera's obsidian resources. American Indians collected obsidian from the Jemez Mountains, including the Cerro del Medio source located entirely within the Valles Caldera, from before 10,000 B.C.E. to at least 1900 C.E. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 92-95, at 50-52. Multiple groups directly obtained obsidian directly from Cerro del Medio or traded with non-Jemez Pueblos to obtain the obsidian, from between 1300 and 1700. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 96, 100-03, at 52, 54-55. The large, non-Jemez Pueblos of Gran Quivira, Pueblo Blanco, and Pueblo Colorado, approximately 100 miles from the Valles Caldera, used Cerro del Medio obsidian in percentages higher than or comparable to contemporaneous Jemez Pueblos. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 106, at 56-57. These Pueblos did not obtain their Cerro del Medio obsidian from Jemez Pueblo. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 106, at X. Moreover, the 2,000-room Pueblo of San Marcos, located dozens of miles to the Valles Caldera's southeast, similarly either collected obsidian directly from Cerro del Medio, or obtained it through trade with Keres or Tewa Pueblos from the 1400s through the Pueblo Revolt. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 106, at 56-57. The evidence establishes that many of the Tewa and Keres sites included in studies conducted at Los Alamos National Labs and Bandelier National Monument on the Valles Caldera's east and southeast sides indicate that Keres and Tewa sites used Cerro del Medio obsidian at a percentage comparable to Jemez Pueblo. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 106, at 56-57. In short, Pueblos other than Jemez Pueblo traveled to Cerro del Medio to obtain obsidian from at least 1300 to 1700 C.E. The record regarding obsidian use therefore proves that many Pueblo and Tribes were actually and continuously using the Valles Caldera to obtain obsidian from before to 1300 C.E. through the twentieth century. 444.\\u2003Studies of tree-ring fire scars prove that ancestral Pueblo peoples intensively used and occupied the Jemez Mountains without any community controlling lands near the Valles Caldera. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 111, 111 n.52 at 58. Moreover, carvings on the Valles Caldera's aspens suggest that individuals associated with numerous non-Jemez Pueblo communities, including six other Pueblos, used the Valles Caldera between the 1890s and the 1980s. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 113-14, at 59-60. Taken together, the archaeological record disproves Jemez Pueblo's claim that it was the Valles Caldera's exclusive user. Such evidence proves instead that, for many centuries, non-Jemez Pueblo American Indians, including the ancestors of numerous modern Pueblos and federally recognized Tribes, wandered throughout and actually used the Valles Caldera used the Valles Caldera to sustain their aboriginal communities in ways substantially similar to Jemez Pueblo. Absent an exception to the exclusive-use requirement, such use defeats Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim. 2. Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera Use Does Not Fit Within the Three Exceptions to the Exclusivity Requirement. 445.\\u2003The ICC, which possessed broad jurisdiction over legal, equitable, and moral claims, created three exceptions to aboriginal title's exclusive-use requirement. See Navajo Tribe of Indians v. State of N.M., 809 F.2d at 1464-66 (concluding that the ICCA gave the ICC \\u201csweeping\\u201d authority to consider \\u201call possible accrued claims\\u201d against the United States, including claims \\u201cof a purely moral nature\\u201d); Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 82, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1098 (discussing the three exceptions to the exclusive use requirement). Accordingly, although Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera use was not exclusive, Jemez Pueblo may nonetheless establish aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera if it can show: (i) that it used the Valles Caldera jointly and amicably with other Tribes; (ii) that it dominated or could have dominated the other Pueblos and Tribes that used the dominated use exception; or (iii) that other Pueblos and Tribes used the Valles Caldera subject to Jemez Pueblo's permission. See Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, Oct. 25 MOO at 82, 350 F. Supp. 3d at 1098. The Court concludes, however, that Jemez Pueblo's historic Valles Caldera use does not satisfy any of the three exceptions to the exclusivity requirement and that Jemez Pueblo therefore cannot establish aboriginal title to the Valles Caldera. a. Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera Use Does Not Satisfy the Joint-and-Amicable Use Exception. 446.\\u2003The joint-and-amicable use exception provides that \\u201ctwo or more tribes or groups might inhabit an area in \\u2018joint and amicable\\u2019 possession without erasing the \\u2018exclusive\\u2019 nature of their use and occupancy,\\u201d and without interrupting the claimant Tribe's ability to establish aboriginal title. Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 561 (quoting United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1394). \\u201cTo qualify for treatment under \\u2018joint and amicable\\u2019 occupancy, the relationship of the Indian groups must be extremely close.\\u201d Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 561. The Court of Claims described such a relationship in Sac & Fox Tribe v. United States: Originally the Sac and Fox Nation consisted of two separate and identifiable tribes of Indians belonging to the Algonquin stock. Around 1735, due to their mutual hostility and conflict with the French, they formed a close and intimate alliance, politically and socially, so that from thence forward they have been dealt with and referred to as a single nation both in their relationship with other Indian tribes and in treaty negotiations and other matters with the United States. 383 F.2d at 995. 447.\\u2003Although the joint possessors must show their relationship is a \\u201cclose and intimate alliance, politically and socially,\\u201d Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 562, it is not necessary for the Tribes to show that they are completely merged, see United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1395 (\\u201cThere are no holdings of this court which say that two Indian tribes or groups, each a separate \\u2018entity\\u2019 and each with its own separate lands, can never assert joint ownership to other lands which are commonly used and occupied.\\u201d). For example, the evidence in United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso showed that two Indian groups objectively believed that they shared common ownership of the land \\u201cin joint tenancy under a 1770 land grant from the Spanish Crown,\\u201d and the Court of Claims held that the Tribes used and occupied the land in joint-and-amicable possession. See United States v. Pueblo of San Ildefonso, 513 F.2d at 1395-96. 448.\\u2003The joint-and-amicable use exception does not apply, however, when \\u201ceach tribe had separate lands, [and] there was no community of interest in the lands,\\u201d because [t]he [Tribes] did not consider themselves, and were not treated, as a single or closely integrated entity, but rather as separate political groups which were friends or allies (for the most part). Their use of the same lands may have been in common, like much of Indian use of the midwestern and western regions -- but the Commission could properly decide that it was not proved to be truly joint, and therefore that each separate tribe's claim to Indian title would have to be tested on its own distinct basis. Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 562. Thus, mere cooperation among two or more Tribes is insufficient to prove joint-and-amicable possession. See Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 562. 449.\\u2003The record contains no evidence that Jemez Pueblo jointly and amicably used and occupied the Valles Caldera with any other Pueblo or Tribe. Far from sharing political and social alliances, Jemez Pueblo, and the Keres and Tewa Pueblos that surround the Valles Caldera, had and continue to maintain distinct cultural traditions and languages that are not mutually intelligible. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 42-44, 75, at 15-17, 43. Although Jemez Pueblo directs the Court to caselaw which, according to Jemez Pueblo, supports its assertion that it satisfies the exclusivity requirement through the joint-and-amicable use exception, it does not attempt to connect the evidence to that caselaw. See Jemez Pueblo's Proposed Conclusions \\u00b6\\u00b6 67-71, at 43-45. Jemez Pueblo elsewhere argues that Cochiti Pueblo member Joseph Suina and Taos Pueblo member Gilbert Suazo's testimony affirming the existence of \\u201clongstanding agreements and relationships among the pueblos\\u201d is sufficient to constitute joint-and-amicable use evidence. Jemez Pueblo's Proposed Findings \\u00b6\\u00b6 56, 59, at 22, 24. The Court notes, however, not only that such testimony is too vague to support joint-and-amicable use, but also [Redacted] see supra FOFs \\u00b6 535 n.170, at 238, evincing discord among the two Pueblos, and that Taos Pueblo's representative was unable to provide any information regarding Tao Pueblo's, or any Pueblo's, Valles Caldera use, see supra FOFs \\u00b6 551 n.176, at 246. 450.\\u2003At least fifteen Pueblos and Tribes used and occupied the Valles Caldera at various times throughout history, and the Court is unpersuaded, absent specific evidence or argument, that so many diverse groups occupied those lands in joint-and-amicable accord. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 56, 58, 60, 72, 73, 74, 110, 111, 112, at 28-32, 39-41, 58-59. To the contrary, the record is replete with evidence that, until the Pueblo Revolt, Jemez Pueblo was so isolated from the Valles Caldera's other aboriginal users as not to engage in any significant trade, and, thereafter, was involved in violent conflict with, at a minimum, San Ildefonso Pueblo, Santa Clara Pueblo, the Jicarilla Apache Nation, the Navajo Nation, and the Ute Tribe. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 89, 90, 165, 173-74, 176, 182, 184, at 49, 84-85, 87-90. Such evidence indicates that Jemez Pueblo enjoyed no alliance -- political, social, or otherwise -- with the Valles Caldera's numerous aboriginal users, and the Court therefore concludes that Jemez Pueblo cannot benefit from the joint-and-amicable use exception to the exclusive use requirement. b. Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera Use Does Not Satisfy the Dominant Use Exception. 451.\\u2003The dominate use exception to the exclusive use rule recognizes that, where another Tribe commonly uses the land with the claimant Tribe, proof of the claimant Tribe's dominance over the other Tribe preserves its exclusive use of the claim area. See United States v. Seminole Indians of Fla., 180 Ct. Cl. at 383-86. The claimant Tribe's dominance illustrates its ability to exclude other Tribes from the area, even if it never chooses to exercise that ability. See United States v. Seminole Indians of Fla., 180 Ct. Cl. at 383. In United States v. Seminole Indians of Florida, for example, the Court of Claims explained that the Seminole Indians obtained aboriginal title to the Florida peninsula, notwithstanding the presence of other Indian tribes, because there was little question that, in their occupation of the land, the Seminoles held a virtual \\u201cmonopoly.\\u201d While expert witnesses concede the contemporaneous existence of other Indians in Florida \\u2024 these scattered groupings were few and far between, and the record offers no evidence to suggest that Seminole dominion was ever challenged by these vestiges of aboriginal cultures. Instead, the pattern that prevailed was one of cultural assimilation -- the Seminoles simply absorbing these \\u201cforeign\\u201d elements into their own ranks. United States v. Seminole Indians of Fla., 180 Ct. Cl. at 383. Thus, the dominant use exception prevails in situations where one Tribe culturally assimilates another Tribe or otherwise exercises complete dominion over \\u201cscattered groupings\\u201d of other Indians that appear \\u201cfew and far between.\\u201d United States v. Seminole Indians of Fla., 180 Ct. Cl. at 383. Accordingly, to satisfy the exclusive use requirement under the dominant use exception, Jemez Pueblo must prove that it dominated, or could have dominated, each of the Pueblos and Tribes that used the Valles Caldera during the relevant historical period. 452.\\u2003The trial establishes that Jemez Pueblo did not dominate the large, ancestral Keres, Tewa, Navajo Nation, and other ancestral American Indian groups that surrounded the Valles Caldera, and accessed those lands to hunt, to gather plants, to collect obsidian, and to conduct other traditional practices beginning in the thirteenth century. Rather than proving Jemez Pueblo's control, the record instead establishes that Jemez Pueblo and ancestral Tewa Tribes, including Santa Clara Pueblo and San Ildefonso Pueblo, used the Valles Caldera at a time when they lacked the requisite amicability even to engage in trade. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 81 n.41, at 46-47. Moreover, although ancestral Tewa peoples and Jemez Pueblo engaged in some trade following the Pueblo Revolt, by 1863, relations between Santa Clara Pueblo and Jemez Pueblo were sufficiently hostile for the Santa Clara Pueblo leader who participated in capturing Jemez Pueblo members between the Valle Grande and Walatowa to equate Jemez Pueblo with Navajo Nation members who stole Santa Clara Pueblo's livestock. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 81 n.41, 89, 90, 182-84, at 46-47, 49-50, 89-90. Such evidence proves that Jemez Pueblo and Santa Clara Pueblo were averse to each other, and therefore unlikely to respect each other's demands, during periods when both Pueblos actually used the Valles Caldera. 453.\\u2003The obsidian record also evinces that Jemez Pueblo did not dominate the Tribes that used Valles Caldera. As stated above, many non-Jemez Pueblos obtained obsidian from the Valles Caldera, and the record contains no evidence that Jemez Pueblo ever controlled access to the Cerro del Medio quarry, which is the only obsidian source that lies entirely within the Valles Caldera's borders. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 94-96, 100-03, at 52, 54-55. Moreover, Jemez Pueblo's focus on the percentage of Cerro del Medio obsidian at Jemez Pueblo-affiliated archeological sites is insufficient to establish dominance, first, because non-Jemez Pueblo affiliated sites suggest Cerro del Medio obsidian use at rates comparable to Jemez Pueblo and, second, because Jemez Pueblo does not suggest that it had a greater population size, and, thus, greater obsidian use in the aggregate than the other Pueblos that used Cerro del Medio obsidian. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 106, at 56-57. Hence, the obsidian record is insufficient to establish that Jemez Pueblo controlled or dominated the Valles Caldera's other aboriginal users access to those lands. 454.\\u2003The trial establishes that most Pueblos could access the Valles Caldera without passing through Jemez Pueblo. Moreover, Zia Pueblo's multiple routes across the Valles Caldera evince particular independence from Jemez Pueblo, because Zia Pueblo's religious societies would use them both to reach [Redacted] and to reach Redondo Peak, and because, during the Coronado Expedition in 1541 C.E., Zia Pueblo advised Captain Francisco Barrionuevo regarding an agreeable, southern route through the Valle Grande that was geographically separate from any route that Jemez Pueblo would have taken during that period. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 56, 307, 374-77, at 28, 134, 174-77. Zia Pueblo also attaches great spiritual significant to the Jemez River tributaries that begin in the Valles Caldera and to [Redacted], access to which requires Zia Pueblo members to pass through Jemez Pueblo's alleged exclusive-use territory in the Banco Bonito. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 380-81, at 178-79. Moreover, Zia Pueblo accessed the Valles Caldera pursuant to its own seven-month religious calendar, i.e., without considering Jemez Pueblo's will regarding such access and use. See supra FOFs \\u00b6 405, at 190. 455.\\u2003The Court finds unpersuasive Jemez Pueblo's argument that theoretical travel time to Redondo Peak evinces Jemez Pueblo's dominance over the Valles Caldera, because this conclusion does not consider that Pueblos other than Jemez Pueblo were much closer than Jemez Pueblo to other points within the Valles Caldera. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 74, 74 n.38, at 40-42. Evidence regarding which Pueblo could more easily access areas within the Valles Caldera does not speak to the legal standard for the dominate-use exception, which requires the claimant Tribe to prove that it exerted dominance over the claim area's other aboriginal users and not that the claimant Tribe merely used the claim area more than other Tribes. See Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 565 (\\u201cIt is clear that the Commission, after finding that the two tribes in question enjoyed \\u2018predominance\\u2019 over certain portions of [the claim area], restricted the determination of aboriginal title to that limited area of land over which the tribes in question enjoyed exclusive occupancy and control.\\u201d). 456.\\u2003Jemez Pueblo's ninety place names within the Valles Caldera also do not affect the Court's analysis under the dominate use exception, as these names do not inform the Court whether Jemez Pueblo controlled other Tribe's access to or use of the areas that the names describe. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 59 n.26, 376 n.140, at 30-32, 176-77. Many Pueblos and Tribes also have place names for sacred areas within the Valles Caldera. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 307, 358, 376, 410, 417, 432, at 134, 167, 176-77, 191-92, 196, 205-06. The Court concludes, therefore, that Jemez Pueblo's focus on place names as a proxy for exclusive use cannot overcome the evidence which proves that other Pueblos and Tribes actually used those lands as well. 457.\\u2003The Court concludes that Jemez Pueblo's population during the relevant period, which the Court considers given that the record does not include evidence that Jemez Pueblo actually dominated the Pueblos and Tribes that used the Valles Caldera, was too small to expel or otherwise affect the Valles Caldera's other aboriginal users. See Native Vill. of Eyak v. Blank, 688 F.3d at 624-25 (concluding that the ability to exercise dominion and control is a function of population \\u201cwhere there is no evidence that the tribes exercised full dominion and control of the claimed area\\u201d). The trial establishes that, beginning in the early 1600s, disease and warfare with the Spanish significantly reduced Jemez Pueblo's population such that, by 1744, there were only between 100 and 200 total Jemez Pueblo members, all of whom lived in Walatowa, over twenty miles from Redondo Peak. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 156, 161, at 81, 82-83. Moreover, although Jemez Pueblo's population gradually increased after 1744, it remained under 1,000 individuals through at least the nineteenth century. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 157-58, at 81-82. During the same period, the Navajo, Jicarilla, and Ute, each of which used the Valles Caldera and was averse to Jemez Pueblo, were larger and more militarily capable than Jemez Pueblo, and, among the Pueblos not openly hostile to Jemez Pueblo, Zia Pueblo at least had a population size greater than Jemez Pueblo, which suggests that Jemez Pueblo could neither defend the Valles Caldera from nor exert its will over these groups. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 159-64, 166, at 82-85. 458.\\u2003The record contains two instances wherein Jemez Pueblo members attacked and defeated Navajo Nation members during the 1800s; however, these events do not establish Jemez Pueblo's dominance over the Navajo Nation, because, first, the record also includes two accounts wherein Navajo Nation members drove Jemez Pueblo members from the Valles Caldera, evidencing that the two groups enjoyed at least equal footing within those lands, and, second, the record also contains evidence that Navajo Nation members worshipped on Redondo Peak, which Jemez Pueblo would not have permitted given that mountain's sacredness to Jemez Pueblo. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 44, 168, 174, 176, 535 n.170, at 16-17, 85, 87, 238. Therefore, even if the Court considers the Navajo Nation's presence in and use of the Valles Caldera as \\u201cscattered\\u201d and \\u201cfew and far between\\u201d -- which the Court does not -- Jemez Pueblo has not shown that it had \\u201ccomplete dominion\\u201d over the Navajo Nation. United States v. Seminole Indians of Fla., 180 Ct. Cl. at 383. 459.\\u2003Moreover, Jemez Pueblo does not argue that it expelled from the Valles Caldera members of the Jicarilla Apache, the Ute Tribe, Santa Clara Pueblo, or San Ildefonso Pueblo, all of whom use those lands and were at times averse to Jemez Pueblo. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 159-64, 166, at 82-85. Significantly, on at least one occasion, members of Santa Clara Pueblo, San Ildefonso Pueblo, and the Ute Tribe imposed their will on Jemez Pueblo, and compelled Jemez Pueblo members to comply with their demands. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 182-84, at 89-90. That other Pueblos and Tribes had the freedom to attack repeatedly Jemez Pueblo and third parties within the Valles Caldera further supports the Court's conclusion that no single Pueblo or Tribe dominated those lands. c. Jemez Pueblo's Valles Caldera Use Does Not Satisfy the Permissive Use Exception. 460.\\u2003The permissive use exception to the exclusive use rule acknowledges that other Indian Tribes could have \\u201crang[ed] over large portions\\u201d of the claimant Tribe's land without defeating the exclusive nature of the claimant Tribe's use, provided that the other Tribes' presence was with the claimant Tribe's permission. Wichita Indian Tribe v. United States, 696 F.2d at 1385. The Federal Circuit in Wichita Indian Tribe v. United States explained that, in light of the other Tribes' friendly relations and trading activities, it required more specific evidence than that of shared hunting grounds to \\u201cjustify a finding of a lack of exclusive use of all the Texas lands.\\u201d 696 F.2d at 1385. Similarly, in Spokane Tribe of Indians v. United States, the Court of Claims admonished the ICC to \\u201cadequately consider whether [the] use by other Indians was by permission and at the sufferance of the [claimant Tribe], or as a matter of right; if the former, the alien visits would not diminish the appellant's Indian title.\\u201d Spokane Tribe of Indians v. United States, 163 Ct. Cl. at 68-69. In Strong v. United States, the Court of Claims affirmed the ICC's finding that the claimant Tribe's presence was \\u201coverwhelmingly predominant and lasted a long time. Those incidents of use and occupancy by other Indians [the court views] as permissive or as so sporadic as not to be inconsistent with [the claimant Tribe's] use and occupancy.\\u201d Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 565. 461.\\u2003To satisfy the permissive use exception, permission need not be explicit, but may be inferred from the record as a whole. See Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 572. The Court of Claims in Strong v. United States found that a Tribe other than the claimant Tribe had two settlements in the claim area and inferred permissive use, stating that [t]here is evidence that the Wyandot had given permission to other Indian tribes to use their lands in Ohio, and we think the record, taken as a whole, supports the inference that the Ottawa were in the Sandusky area with the consent of the Wyandot. Permissive use by the Ottawa did not diminish the title of the Wyandot, and by the same token, such use gave the Ottawa no interest in the land. Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 572. 462.\\u2003The record contains no evidence that other Tribes -- either historically or in modern times -- have asked Jemez Pueblo's permission to enter the Valles Caldera. The Court notes that a practice among Pueblos is to seek permission before entering lands that one Pueblo views as another Pueblo's exclusive aboriginal domain, and the record includes evidence that other Pueblos ask Jemez Pueblo's permission to enter Jemez Pueblo's Tribal trust lands, yet the record is silent regarding any Tribe requesting from another Tribe permission to access and use the Valles Caldera. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 74, 74 n.36, at 40-42. Moreover, representatives from the Pueblos of Cochiti and Santa Clara testified at trial that their respective Pueblos do not request permission from Jemez Pueblo before using the Valles Caldera, which is in accord with the Eight Northern Pueblos Council's 2001 resolution asserting that, without referencing permission from Jemez Pueblo, multiple Pueblos have used the Valles Caldera since time immemorial. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 361, 410 n.145, 527, at 68-69, 91-92, 232. Moreover, the resolutions that Jemez Pueblo obtained from other Tribes during this litigation's pendency evidence only Jemez Pueblo's acute connection to the Valles Caldera; they are insufficient to establish that the Pueblos referenced therein have requested Jemez Pueblo's permission to use those lands since time immemorial. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 361, 410 n.145, 527, at 68-69, 91-92, 232. The Court concludes therefore that no evidence supports Jemez Pueblo's assertion that the Valles Caldera's aboriginal occupants used those lands subject to Jemez Pueblo's permission. 463.\\u2003The record also does not support an inference that other Pueblos' Valles Caldera use was subject to Jemez Pueblo's permission, because such use was deliberate, longstanding and substantial, that is, not sporadic or to facilitate trade. See Wichita Indian Tribe v. United States, 696 F.2d at 1385; Strong v. United States, 518 F.2d at 565. As stated above, numerous Pueblos and Tribes used the Valles Caldera to hunt, to gather plants, to collect obsidian, and to conduct other traditional practices in the centuries before trade occurred, i.e., during a period when Jemez Pueblo's relationship with these groups was either nonexistent or belligerent. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 56, 58, 60, 72, 73, 74, 81 n.41, 89, 90, 110, 111, 112, at 28-33, 39-41, 46, 49-50, 58-59. Moreover, Jemez Pueblo's relations with its neighbors were not universally warm in the centuries following the Pueblo Revolt, and the record evidences numerous, hostile engagements between 1680 and 1863, the most recent of which ended with Jemez Pueblo submitting to Santa Clara Pueblo, San Ildefonso Pueblo, and the Ute Tribe's authority. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 162-66, 182-84, at 83-85, 89-90. Hence, Santa Clara, San Ildefonso, Jicarilla, Navajo, and Ute members each used the Valles Caldera while adverse to Jemez Pueblo during periods spanning from 1300 C.E. through at least 1863, and use after the seventeenth century occurred when many Pueblos and Tribes outnumbered and were militarily superior to Jemez Pueblo. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 156-66, at 81-85. These adverse Tribes, at a minimum, therefore did not use the Valles Caldera subject to Jemez Pueblo's permission, which, standing alone, defeats Jemez Pueblo's ability to benefit from the permissive-use exception to the exclusive use requirement. 464.\\u2003The evidence that other Pueblos and Tribes have for many years held sacred and actually used Redondo Peak for traditional, religious activity, further supports the Court's conclusion that aboriginal groups did not use the Valles Caldera subject to Jemez Pueblo's permission. The trial establishes that at least fifteen Pueblos and Tribes other than Jemez Pueblo have religious traditions which venerate Redondo Peak and include making pilgrimages to worship at shrines on that mountain, and that such use has occurred since before the Spanish colonial period and has never required these Pueblos or Tribes to pass through Jemez Pueblo villages. See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 44, 47 n.16, 48 n.17, 49, 50, 61, 73, 134, 167, 244, 275, 279, 294, 299, 301-02, 304, 306, 308, 311, 315-16, 319, 370-72, 374, 376-77, 379-80, 382-85, 387-89, 391-400, 402, 406, 409, 410, 411, 526, at 16-18, 20-23, 33-35, 39, 69-70, 85, 105-06, 118-19, 129-40, 172-192, 231-32. Trial further establishes that, despite Jemez Pueblo's admissions before the ICC that, at least during the 1950s, it used the area jointly with the Pueblos of San Ildefonso, Santa Ana, Santa Clara, and Zia, see supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 271-73, 275, 279, at 117-19, Jemez Pueblo nonetheless considers such use offensive, and asserts either that it does not occur or that it occurs over Jemez Pueblo's strong objections, see supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 384 n.140, 567 n.177, 330, 386, at 179-81. For example, when Jemez Pueblo [Redacted] See supra FOFs \\u00b6\\u00b6 373 n.138, 385, 385 n.143, 386, 386 n.144, at 174, 181-83. That Jemez Pueblo denies and opposes other Tribe's Redondo Peak use indicates not only Jemez Pueblo's ignorance regarding other Tribes' cultural practices, but also that other Pueblos and Tribes do not use the Valles Caldera subject to Jemez Pueblo's express or implied permission. IT IS ORDERED that: (i) Plaintiff Pueblo of Jemez does not possess aboriginal title to the lands that encompass the Valles Caldera National Preserve, and, accordingly, does not have the exclusive right to use, occupy, and possess those lands; (ii) title to the Valles Caldera National Preserve is quieted in Defendant United States of America; (iii) the case is dismissed with prejudice; and (iv) if the parties seek any attorney's fees and costs, they should proceed pursuant to D.N.M.LR-Civ. 54.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"len_postures\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ohe_postures\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"headtext\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 90,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"10.\\u2003The Bench Trial.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"paragraphs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1165,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"423.\\u2003The Court declines to adopt the United States' contention that \\u201cinterference by the Preserve land's private owners with Plaintiff's alleged aboriginal uses prior to 2000, standing alone, is sufficient to defeat any claim to aboriginal title.\\u201d United States' Proposed Conclusions \\u00b6\\u00b6 80, at 20. The United States bases this assertion on the Tenth Circuit's conclusion that \\u201cif there was actually substantial interference by others with these traditional uses \\u2024 Jemez Pueblo will not be able to establish aboriginal title.\\u201d United States' Br. at 74 (quoting Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166). This statement does not, however, stand for the United States' proposition that \\u201c[t]he Tenth Circuit, relying in part on precedents of the Court of Claims, held that federal conveyance of land to private parties, and encroachment on traditional Tribal use, can evidence extinguishment of aboriginal title,\\u201d United States' Br. at 75 (citing Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166-67), in part, because the Court must consider the Tenth Circuit's comment alongside controlling Supreme Court precedent, and the Supreme Court has held that congressional intent to extinguish aboriginal title must be \\u201cplain and unambiguous,\\u201d Santa Fe, 314 U.S. at 346, 62 S.Ct. 248. Hence, the Court concludes that, to defeat Jemez Pueblo's aboriginal title claim, the \\u201cinterference\\u201d to which the Tenth Circuit refers must be sufficiently \\u201csubstantial\\u201d to compel Jemez Pueblo to cease altogether its Valles Caldera use for traditional, aboriginal purposes. Pueblo of Jemez v. United States, 790 F.3d at 1166. The Court therefore considers any such interference not in a vacuum but rather for the effect that the interference had on Jemez Pueblo's ability to conduct its traditional activities within the Valles Caldera, specifically whether the interference compelled Jemez Pueblo not to use the Valles Caldera during the private ownership period.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The plaintiff is the owner of a building located in Brooklyn (hereinafter the premises). \\u2002In October 2017, the Civil Court, Kings County, Housing Part (hereinafter the Housing Court), appointed the defendant as the administrator of the premises pursuant to RPAPL 778. \\u2002In December 2017, the plaintiff commenced the instant action in the Supreme Court, Kings County, against the defendant alleging, inter alia, that the defendant intentionally destroyed certain property on the premises. \\u2002Prior to answering, the defendant moved pursuant to CPLR 3211(a) to dismiss the complaint upon the ground, among others, that the plaintiff failed to obtain the required leave of court before commencing the action. \\u2002The Supreme Court granted the defendant's motion. \\u2002The plaintiff appeals, and we affirm. The role of an RPAPL article 7\\u2013A administrator is closely related to that of a receiver (see Seril v. Belnord Tenants Assn., 235 A.D.2d 214, 214, 651 N.Y.S.2d 522; \\u2009Abdul v. Hirschfield, 21 Misc.3d 764, 772, 865 N.Y.S.2d 537 [Sup. Ct., Kings County], mod 71 A.D.3d 707, 898 N.Y.S.2d 44; \\u2009Mercer v. 944 Marcy Ave. Holding Corp., 92 Misc.2d 564, 565\\u2013566, 400 N.Y.S.2d 991 [Civ. Ct., Kings County]). \\u2002Permission of the appointing court is generally required before commencing an action against an administrator (see Copeland v. Salomon, 56 N.Y.2d 222, 228, 451 N.Y.S.2d 682, 436 N.E.2d 1284). \\u2002However, \\u201c[p]ermission from the appointing court [is] a condition precedent to suit and not a jurisdictional predicate without which a suit must be dismissed\\u201d (Independence Sav. Bank v. Triz Realty Corp., 100 A.D.2d 613, 614, 473 N.Y.S.2d 568; \\u2009see Copeland v. Salomon, 56 N.Y.2d at 228, 451 N.Y.S.2d 682, 436 N.E.2d 1284). \\u2002Accordingly, there are three alternatives that a court may follow when an action against a receiver or administrator is commenced without permission from the appointing court: \\u2009(1) \\u201cthe court in which the action had been begun was free to consider it regular and permit it to continue subject to the later order of the appointing court\\u201d; \\u2009(2) the action may be stayed \\u201cpending an application to the appointing court for leave nunc pro tunc\\u201d; \\u2009or (3) the action may be dismissed \\u201cwithout prejudice to recommencement after such leave had been obtained\\u201d (Copeland v. Salomon, 56 N.Y.2d at 230, 451 N.Y.S.2d 682, 436 N.E.2d 1284; \\u2009see Independence Sav. Bank v. Triz Realty Corp., 100 A.D.2d at 614, 473 N.Y.S.2d 568; \\u2009Pires v. Williams, 32 Misc.3d 221, 223\\u2013224, 922 N.Y.S.2d 766 [Civ. Ct., Kings County]). Here, the plaintiff did not obtain permission from the Housing Court prior to commencing this action, nor did he seek permission nunc pro tunc. \\u2002Under the circumstances, the Supreme Court did not improvidently exercise its discretion in directing dismissal of the instant action, although it was not required to do so (see Copeland v. Salomon, 56 N.Y.2d at 230, 451 N.Y.S.2d 682, 436 N.E.2d 1284; \\u2009Guberman v. Rudder, 85 A.D.3d 683, 684, 927 N.Y.S.2d 32; \\u2009Chang v. Zapson, 67 A.D.3d 435, 435, 890 N.Y.S.2d 463). \\u2002Among other reasons, the record reflects that many of the issues raised in the complaint in the instant action were simultaneously raised by the plaintiff in a motion before the Housing Court to remove the defendant as administrator. \\u2002Contrary to the plaintiff's contention, whether the Housing Court would ultimately have subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiff's claims is irrelevant to whether he is required to obtain permission from the Housing Court in order to maintain an action against the administrator (see Independence Sav. Bank v. Triz Realty Corp., 100 A.D.2d at 614, 473 N.Y.S.2d 568). We reject the defendant's contention that this appeal was untimely perfected, as this Court provided the plaintiff with an extension of time to perfect the appeal, and he did so within the time allotted. In light of our determination, we need not reach the parties' remaining contentions.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"len_postures\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 2,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"ohe_postures\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"headtext\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"DECISION & ORDER\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"paragraphs\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"ORDERED that the order is affirmed, with costs.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
